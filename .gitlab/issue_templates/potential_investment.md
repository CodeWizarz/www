# Process for creating an investment proposal

1. PM sponsors the project.
1. PM articulates business need/driver.
1. PM builds a financial business case using the  `ROI calculation spreadsheet` template.
1. PM adds a link to the spreadsheet for this proposal and copies the summary of ROI output to this issue
1. PM tags appropriate stakeholders including product managers, engineer directors, UX, Quality, Data team, etc as appropriate so they can collaborate on it.
1. Stakeholders collaborate on the potential investment asynchronously via the issue 

# Investment proposal

## Project sponsor

* Use the [Opportunity Canvas](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-processes/#opportunity-canvas)

## Project description

TBD

### ROI spreadsheet link

TBD



## ROI calculation spreadsheet

Make a copy of the `ROI calculation spreadsheet` from this [template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1H928LocTb7cWuQoNVwI7kG-z9pwDYmbbQv7Sr141sOc/edit#gid=1846081069) and fill it out.

It includes an analysis of:
* How many of which roles are needed, and when they are needed
* Prediction on increase in ARR
* Prediction on increase in licenses by type
* Prediction on new market TAM impact
* Prediction on reduced support and/or infrastructure costs
* Operational and/or security risk reduction

This is used to compare and contrast this potential investment with others that are under consideration.

### Simplified ROI Sensitivity Analysis

* ROI projections at this early phase are estimates at best. Sensitivity analysis helps showcase the range of possible outcomes to accommodate for the inherent uncertainty with these opportunities.
