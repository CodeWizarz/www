<!-- PLEASE READ: This template can help codify the decision section in the Handbook https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/leadership/making-decisions/#tips-for-dris-in-making-decisions. See https://coda.io/@gokulrajaram/gokuls-spade-toolkit for details on the SPADE Decision Making. -->

## Setting
<!-- 
1. Precisely define the “what.” What decision is being made? What is the scope of the decision? Does this impact the product, the platform, or the entire company? Be as specific as possible 
2. Be clear on the "when." Explain the why of the “when.” Why that date? Why that duration? 
3. Explain the "why." Clearly establishing the why is the key to the setting. 
4. Make that iteration scope is clear. Include a statement on how you are taking an iterative approach. Otherwise said, could this decision be broken into even smaller parts?-->

## People
<!-- Note who was consulted in the decision and proposal alternatives. Document who was involved and their role in the decision. Identify the people who should consult (give input), approve, and most importantly, a single person who is responsible (DRI). This helps the team visually see if we have been inclusive in the data gathering phase.  -->
