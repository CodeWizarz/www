## Program Overview 

Thank you for your interest in the GitLab Volunteer program. Through the GitLab Volunteer Program, GitLab team members are able to organize volunteer activities in their local community or virtually. 

## Eligibility 

GitLab supports registered 501c3 (or country equivalent) nonprofit organizations in good standing that align with our [Values](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/). A “Registered Nonprofit Organization” is one that has been registered with the local government or authorized agency within its applicable local, state, provincial, federal, or national government. 

GitLab prioritizes volunteering with organizations whose mission align with our values, support our environmental and social goals, and help us advance our mission to make it so that everyone can contribute. Although, we do consider organizations for volunteer work outside of our key focus areas as long as they meet the other eligibility criteria. Our current social and environmental focus areas are:

- Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging 
- Talent Management 
- Climate Action
