## Program Overview 

Thank you for your interest in partnering with GitLab. Through the corporate philanthropy program, GitLab supports registered nonprofit organizations with monetary contributions. 

## Eligibility 

GitLab supports registered 501c3 (or country equivalent) nonprofit organizations in good standing that align with our [Values](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/). A “Registered Nonprofit Organization” is one that has been registered with the local government or authorized agency within its applicable local, state, provincial, federal, or national government. 

GitLab prioritizes financial contributions to organizations that align with our values, support our environmental and social goals, and help us advance our mission to make it so that everyone can contribute. We endeavor to build long-term partnerships with community organizations and avoid a transactional approach to our corporate giving.   Our current social and environmental focus areas are:

- Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging 
- Talent Management 
- Climate Action
