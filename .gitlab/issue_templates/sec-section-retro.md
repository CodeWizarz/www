## Group Retrospectives

At the end of every release, each group should conduct their own retrospective. For details on how this is done, see [Group Retrospectives](/handbook/engineering/management/group-retrospectives/).

### Group Retrospective Tasks

While performing your Group Retrospectives:
1. Please conduct your Group Retrospective following the guidelines outlined in the [handbook](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/management/group-retrospectives/).
1. After the Group Retrospective is complete, please choose a subset some of your most interesting learnings to share section-wide in the [retro doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g_FIMgr9r_Yf56xISxoI8B-1G-kbP3PQSeo7W-kKj24/edit#).  Please try to group by these by our [CREDIT values](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/values/).
1. In the [retro doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g_FIMgr9r_Yf56xISxoI8B-1G-kbP3PQSeo7W-kKj24/edit#), if there is a learning that you would like to explicitly highlight, please add the text **highlight** at the beginning of the text. The moderator will highlight this along with other learnings listed in the retro doc when they create the pre-recorded video.
1. If there are improvement tasks for your group from the previous retrospective, please provide an update on them in the retro doc. They will be verbalized during the Retrospective Discussion.
1. If there are improvement tasks for your group in the current retrospective, please add them in the [retro doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g_FIMgr9r_Yf56xISxoI8B-1G-kbP3PQSeo7W-kKj24/edit#). They will be verbalized during the Retrospective Discussion.

## Retrospective Summary

The Retrospective Summary is a short pre-recorded video which summarizes the learnings across all [Group Retrospectives](/handbook/engineering/management/group-retrospectives/) ([example video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdENBhVOSiw&feature=youtu.be), [example presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kH9TwUAXbslM1cac938hS4Y-3mEBojQlwHw_Mm44kDE/edit?usp=sharing)).

Once all Group Retrospectives are completed, each group inputs their learnings into a single publicly-accessible [retro doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g_FIMgr9r_Yf56xISxoI8B-1G-kbP3PQSeo7W-kKj24/edit#). The  moderator then pre-records a video of the highlights. This video is then announced in the Retrospective planning and execution issue along with the #whats-happening-at-gitlab slack channel. In line with our value of [transparency](/handbook/values/#transparency), we also post this video to our public [GitLab Unfiltered channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/GitLabUnfiltered/videos).

## Retrospective Discussion

The Retrospective Discussion is a 25 minute live discussion among participants where we deep dive into discussion topics from our Group Retrospectives ([example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP9E7RbNSPw)). In line with our value of [transparency](/handbook/values/#transparency), we livestream this meeting to YouTube and monitor chat for questions from viewers. Please check the [retro doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g_FIMgr9r_Yf56xISxoI8B-1G-kbP3PQSeo7W-kKj24/edit#) for details on joining the livestream.
