### Purpose

**This issue will be used to request Cognism/Zoominfo Enrichment of lists with records that do not contain an email address.** For matches against their database, on top of email, Zoominfo provides additional person information or firmographic data; This info will also be added to the the output CSV file so make sure to clean-up it up to make sure you only upload the needed info.

### üìù Keep in Mind
  
- :eight\_spoked\_asterisk:  Records that do not have an email address cannot be imported in SFDC. 
- :eight\_spoked\_asterisk:  Records that are sub-sequently enriched with the email address through Zoominfo/Cognism enrichment need to be marked `Opt-out` as **these individuals did not give us the express consent** that they can be reached to; 

### :notepad\_spiral: Items:  

- [] Add information on how was the list obtained (i.e: Event Name & Description);
- [] Provide the **CSV list** and attach it to this issue template.

### Marketing Operations Instructions --MOPS use Only--
**NOTE: Mops will use the Zoominfo Enhance, Zoominfo ListMatch and Cognism Enhance features to enrich these CSV lists and we'll add the output information in appropriately named tabs in the spreadsheet.**

*Zoominfo ListMatch*
* Download the CSV list provided in the issue template
* Navigate to the **Lists** tab and select **Upload Lists**
* In the pop-up, indicate whether you are matching a list of Contacts or Companies. The second question will default to ListMatch, which is what you want for this motion.
* Click **Next**, then choose to **Upload .CSV** or use **Text Input**
     - CSV files do not need to be specially formatted, as SalesOS will read the file and map data points. You will have the chance to verify before submitting.
     - Text Input can include **Company Names**, **Company URLs**, or **Contact Emails**, and you can simply cut and paste into the text box with one item per line.
* [ ] Click **Submit** after naming your file
* Add a **Description** and/or Tag (‚ÄúEvent_name List Upload‚Äù for example) and click **Next**
* On the **Mapping screen**, you can verify that all of your records were correctly matched. For example, you might have a column that says **Website**. SalesOS is smart enough to map that column to the URL field. There are many possible data points that can be mapped, but you only need to check those you know were in your file.
* Click **Submit** when the correct fields are Mapped with a checkmark. Your **List** will be visible under **All Lists** and **Uploaded** and when ready, will be accessible from the main **Lists** page or **Processed** tab.
* Once your list is ready, the ellipsis alongside it will give you options to **Redeem**, **Rename**, or **Open in Search**.
     - **Open in Search** is the best option if you are looking to filter and refine the list (perhaps you uploaded a list of companies and now you need contacts).
     - **Redeem** is the best option if you uploaded a list to append data and want to export for use or to share with someone else.

*Zoominfo Enhance*
* Click the **Lists** tab;
* Click **Upload** Lists;
* Inside the pop-up, choose either **Companies** or **Contacts**, and then select **Enhance** (the second option);
* Click **Next**;
* Upload the CSV file you wish to have Enhanced;
* Click **Submit** 
* Customize **Export Settings** if you choose (to reflect unique fields that might be part of your List already);
* Ensure that your data points are reflected on the **Mapping** screen;
* Click **Submit** and then click **Finish**;
* Your file will be processed and accessible under the **Processed** tab when ready.

*Cognism Enhance*
* Go to the **Enhance** Tab;
* Click **Enhance New List**;
* Give your list a name and click **Next**;
* Select the **CSV File** you want to use and click **Next**. For optimal results, use the format in [this template](https://app-staging.cognism.com/enhance/assets/files/sample-list.csv). **The maximum file size that you can upload is 16MB**;
* Configure the field mappings by choosing the options in the dropdown lists and click **Enhance my List**. This will be used to map your data with the Cognism data;
* Click **Go to Lists** where you can see the updated list once it has been processed.
