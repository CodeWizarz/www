# What Is A Team Trust Assessment

A Team Trust Assessment is a quick and easy survey to give to your team that will assess their level of trust/psychological safety with your team and its team members. The assessment is designed to be quick and painless and shouldn't take someone more than 5 minutes to complete. 

Note: 

* This type of assessment is meant for long-term teams that have had the opportunity to build habits and practices. Teams that are put together on a temporary basis, such as Working Groups, should not use this form of measurement.
* Measuring your team's trust/psychological safety is important. It's equally important, if not more important, to follow up on the results. You can end up degrading trust if you assess your team's trust/psychological safety and then do nothing with what you've learned.

# What Is Trust / Psychological Safety

High-performing teams have high amounts of trust among team members. This can be characterized as having psychological safety which is a shared belief held by team members that the team is safe for interpersonal risk taking. Teams with high trust or psychological safety tend to:

- Have an increase in collaboration, innovation, inclusion, well-being, and adaptable
- Demonstrate vulnerability
- Take moderate risks
- Raise difficult issues/concerns as opposed to hiding them
- Speak their mind as opposed to keeping quiet
- Foster creativity
- Be curious and ask questions
- Invite and give feedback
- Ask for help when needed
- Take ownership and not distance themselves from mistakes or place blame

**A trusting team is** when people feel safe. When they feel they can be vulnerable on their own. They can raise their hand and say “I made a mistake.” Or “you promoted me to a position where I don’t really know what to do I think I need more training.” or “I’m having trouble at home and it’s affecting my work.”

Without any fear or humiliation or retribution. In fact, they say these things with confidence that their leaders and colleagues will rush to support them.

# What Is NOT Trust / Psychological Safety

* It's not about being "nice" but instead is about candor, about making it possible for productive disagreement and the free exchange of ideas.
* It's not a personality factor but is a safe climate where people will offer ideas and voice their concerns regardless of whether they tend toward introversion or extroversion.
* It's not just about trust, to trust someone is to give them the benefit of the doubt. Trust in Psychological Safety is whether or not others will you the benefit of the doubt when you've asked for help or admitted a mistake.
* It's not about lowering performance standards but is instead about being conducive to setting ambitious goals and working toward them together.

**A team that lacks trust** will hide mistakes for fear of getting in trouble. They won’t admit that they have no idea what they're doing in their new promotion but will continue to fake it. They would never tell you they’re suffering undue stress because of something that’s happening at home and that it’s affecting their work. They definitely won’t ask for help for fear that they’ll find themselves on the short list of the next round of redundancies. Eventually, cracks will show up and the org will break. This isn’t because of the people but because of the leaders, leading the people.

# How Do I Cultivate Trust / Psychological Safety

1. Pay attention to how your actions are being perceived. Others may perceive your actions differently than you intended.
   1. Ask yourself, is your intent coming across the way think or meant it to?
   2. To help avoid this, understand your team members' communication and work styles.
2. Assume and operate with positive intent.
   1. Provide space for others to contribute, and be open to feedback.
   2. Acknowledge and apologize when you get it wrong, recognizing learning opportunities.
3. Have moral courage.
   1. Practice and strive for bravery for ethical and moral reasons, even when it is a risk or inconvenient for you. Including taking responsibility for making the environment psychologically unsafe.

**As a leader, ask yourself:** How do we as a team create an environment in which our team members can work at their natural best? It's your responsibility as their leader to set the environment. Leaders aren't responsible for the results, they're responsible for the _people_ who are responsible for the results.

Remember, that developing trusting, psychologically safe teams is like getting into shape. Once you've achieved your goal you have to maintain it, every day, consistently or it will revert back to what it was before.

# Why Measure A Team's Trust / Psychological Safety

Every organization and therefore their teams want to be more innovative, creative, and collaborative. Trust and psychological safety are correlated to these positive organizational attributes. Therefore, it's worthwhile to measure, assess, and cultivate it on your teams.

Measuring psychological safety can also help you understand the cause of other important metrics such as retention. Team members stick with a job when it gives them a sense of purpose, when there’s no micromanagement, and when they can work effectively with their colleagues.

You can measure the amount of trust/psychological safety through pulse surveys distributed to different teams. These surveys can be distributed to teams at any level in the organization, department, stage, section, group, etc.

It's recommended to measure your team's trust/psychological survey on a quarterly basis, using your first survey as a baseline to measure future results.
