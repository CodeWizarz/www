## 3-Year Strategy

## What's Next

The below plan can change at any moment and should not be taken as a hard commitment, though we do try to keep things generally stable. In general, we follow the same [prioritization guidelines](/handbook/product/product-processes/#how-we-prioritize-work) as the product team at large. Issues will tend to flow from having no milestone, to being added to the backlog, to being added to this page and/or a specific milestone for delivery.
