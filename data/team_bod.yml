        Sid Sijbrandij (pronounced see-brandy) is the Co-founder, Chief
        Executive Officer and Board Chair of GitLab Inc., the DevOps platform.
        GitLab’s single application helps organizations deliver software faster
        and more efficiently while strengthening their security and compliance.


        Sid’s career path has been anything but traditional. He spent four years
        building recreational submarines for U-Boat Worx and while at Ministerie
        van Justitie en Veiligheid he worked on the Legis project, which
        developed several innovative web applications to aid lawmaking. He first
        saw Ruby code in 2007 and loved it so much that he taught himself how to
        program. In 2012, as a Ruby programmer, he encountered GitLab and
        discovered his passion for open source. Soon after, Sid commercialized
        GitLab, and by 2015 he led the company through Y Combinator’s Winter
        2015 batch. Under his leadership, the company has grown with an
        estimated 30 million+ registered users from startups to global
        enterprises.


        Sid studied at the University of Twente in the Netherlands where he
        received an M.S. in Management Science. Sid was named one of the
        greatest minds of the pandemic by
        [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/elisabethbrier/2021/03/05/top-business-minds-of-the-pandemic/?sh=773356ef22ad)
