- name: Percent of team members outside compensation band
  base_path: /handbook/people-group/people-success-performance-indicators/
  definition: This metric is manually calculated by the Total Rewards Team, and will be moved over once we start using Compass. The Total Rewards Analysts will analyze against how many team members in a division or department are compensated outside the bands specific by our Global Compensation policy. The weights being used are 0.25 for % outside top end of comp band between 0.01% to 4.9%; 0.5 for band between 5% to 9.9%; 0.75 for band 10% to 14.9%; 1 for anything 15%+.  The purpose of weighting how far over someone is from compensation band is to ensure if there are those outside of comp band slightly, they are not held at the same level as those hired well over rang
