  base_path: "/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/performance-indicators/"
  definition: A GitLab
    Meetup is defined as a meetup with a presentation given by a GitLab team member
    or a wider community member about GitLab or a tangential topic. It does not include
    meetups without GitLab content where GitLab only provides support. This KPI is
    tracked by counting the number of issues in the GitLab.com data with the <a href="https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/-/boards/962542?label_name[]=Meetups">Meetups
    label</a> in the Marketing group.<br><br> Each event should have one associated issue
    with the <em>Meetups</em> label. The issue due date should be set to the event date.
    The combination of <em>Meetups</em> label and due date will be used by our data dashboard
    to count the number of meetups each month. This method of tracking can results
    in errors when meetup issues are created in other groups or when GitLab-related
    presentations at meetups are not shared with the Developer Relations team.

- name: MRARR
  base_path: "/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/performance-indicators/"
  definition: MRARR (pronounced "mer-arr," like a pirate) is the measurement of Merge Requests from customers, multiplied with
    the revenue of the account (ARR) from that customer. This measures how active our biggest customers are contributing to GitLab.
    We believe the higher this number the better we'll retain these customers and improve product fit for large enterprises.
    The unit of MRARR is MR Dollars (MR$). MR Dollars is different than the normal Dollars which is used for ARR.
    We are tracking current initiatives to improve this in this <a href="https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/epics/1225">epic</a>. <figure class="video_container"> <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HjWwpPU3KDU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"> </iframe></figure>
