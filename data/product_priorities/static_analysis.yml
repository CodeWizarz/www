priorities:
- name: "Improve rulesets in Semgrep-based scanning"
  url: "https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/10907"
  rationale: "SAST is a high business priority, and false positives significantly impact customers"
  needs: "Static Analysis backend engineering to support rollout, including auto-resolution. Vulnerabilty Research for rule updates."
  status: "False-positive reduction is currently in progress and targeted for 16.4, with additional updates to come. See [iteration plan](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/10907#plan) for details."
- name: "Add SAST findings to the MR Changes tab"
  url: "https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/10959"
  rationale: "Massive UX improvement for the most common task: triaging findings. Near-complete development should be finished."
  needs: "Frontend engineer (1)"
  status: "In progress. Iteration 1 complete, Iteration 2 in progress. Both to be released together."
- name: "Finish MR findings in IDE"
  url: "https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/10996"
  rationale: "Improve UX of new feature while context is fresh."
  needs: "Frontend engineer (1)"
  status: "In progress."
- name: "Secret Detection POC"
  url: "https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/422574"
  rationale: "Net-new customer value. New MVC possibility that came up recently and may deliver value faster."
  needs: "Backend engineers (multiple)"
  status: "Research spikes in progress."

ux_priorities:
- name: "Identify any post-MVC changes needed in the IDE integration"
  url: "https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/10996"
  rationale: "We are getting ready to pause this initiative and would like to have a clean place to wrap up."
  needs: "UX assessment/testing of existing feature"
  status: "Development in progress; UX review in progress (issues filed)"
- name: "Support the delivery of SAST findings in the MR Changes tab"
  url: "https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/10959"
  rationale: "Important feature is near delivery"
  needs: "Identify any risks or blockers to shipping. Provide reactive support to FE eng as needed."
  status: "Development in progress; needs UX review"
- name: "Finalize assumptive Jobs To Be Done for SAST remediation workflow"
  url: "https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ux-research/-/issues/2573"
  rationale: "Focus is on the remediation workflow because more users are exposed to this flow (all developers) than the configuration flow (mostly security admins)"
  needs: "Collaborate with UX Research"
  status: "UXR started"
- name: "Create assumptive Jobs To Be Done for Secret Detection remediation workflow"
  url: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ux-research/-/issues/2573"
  rationale: "Existing JTBDs focus more on AppSec vulnerabilities that can be remediated with a new code change; secret leaks can't be fixed that way. New JTBD canvas should explore the security incident response job performer in greater detail to prepare for larger changes to Secret Detection."
  needs: "Collaborate with UX Research"
  status: "UXR starting soon"
- name: "Big-picture design for revamped Secret Detection"
  url: "https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8667"
  rationale: "We're getting ready to implement new architectural patterns for Secret Detection based on recent technical research. As we plan new flows and system components, we should take the opportunity to make sure we are meeting our job performers' needs well."
  needs: "Collaborate with UX Research on JTBDs; create low-fidelity designs or other artifacts to show users will complete their jobs"
  status: "Not yet started"
