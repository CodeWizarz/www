    description: |
      In GitLab 12.7, the Redis version [was updated to Redis 5](/releases/2020/01/22/gitlab-12-7-released/#omnibus-improvements). Redis 4 [has reached end of life](https://docs.redislabs.com/latest/rs/administering/product-lifecycle/) and will no longer be supported as of GitLab 14.0. If you are using your own Redis 4.x instance, you should upgrade it to Redis 5.x or 6.x before GitLab 14.0 is released.
