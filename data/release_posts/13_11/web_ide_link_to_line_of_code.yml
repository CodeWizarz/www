      Collaborating on long files is easier when you can share a link to a specific line of code. Previously, you could only link to a line number when viewing a file in the repository, but now you can also link to specific lines of code in the context of editing a file. Previously announced [in GitLab 13.10 for SaaS customers](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2021/03/22/gitlab-13-10-released/#deep-link-directly-to-lines-of-code), this feature is now available to everyone.

      To get a link to a specific line, click the icon in the gutter next to the line number, or append `#L` followed by the line number to the edit URL. The link will open the editor, scroll to the line, and highlight it for you. Try it out in the single-file editor, the Web IDE, and the Pipeline Editor!

      Tip: you can even create a link to multiple lines by appending a range to the link, like `#L87-98`, even though the UI doesn't support creating these (yet).
