    description: |
      Group owners can now register OAuth applications for a group. Previously, OAuth applications could only be registered by individual users or at the instance level. Making this functionality available at the group level reduces the administrative burden for instance administrators and removes the dependency on individual users for the configuration of OAuth applications. 

      Thanks to the amazing work from GitLab contributor Jonas WÃ¤lter from Siemens, this feature is now available in 13.11.
