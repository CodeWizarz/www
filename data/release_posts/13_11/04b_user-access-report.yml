      description: |
        Compliance-minded organizations have a recurring requirement to audit the access their users have to company systems and resources. Previously, achieving this in
        GitLab required building custom tooling with our [audit-related APIs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/audit_reports.html#apis)
        to assemble the data you needed.
        
        Now, you can simply click an `export` button in the admin area of your self-managed GitLab instance to retrieve a CSV file containing a list of each user and the groups, subgroups,
        and projects they have access to. It is now much easier to audit your user access in a
        lot less time.
