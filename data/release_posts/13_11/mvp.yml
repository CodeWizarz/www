    In the last month, Yogi has made multiple contributions to the GitLab Status Page which have improved performance, polished the UI, and brought us closer to our ultimate vision. Yogi added the [banner systems notice](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/status-page/-/merge_requests/265) which helps users understand from a glance if there is an incident or if all systems are operational. He optimized the [mobile view to be more responsive](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/status-page/-/merge_requests/203) so that on-call responders have a better experience on their devices. He also moved [Incidents and Incident comments to vue.js components](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/status-page/-/merge_requests/257) which helps us create a consistent and lovable user experience across the product. 
    
    This is not Yogi's first time being selected as GitLab's MVP - he was also recognized in 13.8 for his 30+ merge requests that fixed long-standing bugs, improved our UX, and helped with our platform consistency. Thank you, Yogi!
