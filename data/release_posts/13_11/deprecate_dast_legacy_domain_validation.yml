  description: |
    Starting with GitLab 13.8, the current method of DAST Domain Validation for CI/CD scans is deprecated. In GitLab 14.0, the legacy DAST validation method will be removed. This method of domain validation only disallows scans if the `DAST_FULL_SCAN_DOMAIN_VALIDATION_REQUIRED` environment variable is set to `true` in the `gitlab-ci.yml` file, and a `Gitlab-DAST-Permission` header on the site is not set to `allow`. This two-step method created a situation in which users had to opt in to using the variable before they could opt out from using the header. For users concerned about protecting a site against a full, active scan, permission for a GitLab DAST scan can still be revoked by adding to any website a `Gitlab-DAST-Permission` header with a value of `deny`. This continues to block GitLab DAST scans attempted against any website that includes this HTTP header.

    For more information, see the [removal issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/293595).
