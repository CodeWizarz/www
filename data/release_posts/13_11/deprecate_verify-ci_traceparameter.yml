deprecations:
- feature_name: "Removal of `trace` parameter from `PUT /api/jobs/:id"
  due: Jun 22, 2020
  reporter: jreporter
  description: |
   Previously, GitLab-Runner would send job trace in two scenarios: during a job is running (via PATCH /api/jobs/:id/trace) and when a job finished (via PUT /api/jobs/:id). We have updated GitLab-Runner to stop sending trace parameter in the second scenario, and will be removing the [trace parameter](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/api/runner.rb#L151) from PUT /api/jobs/:id endpoint in GitLab-Rails.
