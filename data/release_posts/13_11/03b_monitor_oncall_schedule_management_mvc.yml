      Software services do not get "turned off" at the end of the business day. Your customers expect 24/7 availability. When things go wrong, you need a team (or multiple teams!) that can quickly and effectively respond to service outages.

      Being on-call can be a stressful job. To better manage stress and burn-out, most teams rotate this on-call responsibility. GitLab's **on-call schedule management** allows you and your team to create and manage schedules for on-call responsibilities. Alerts received in GitLab through an HTTP endpoint are routed to the on-call engineer in the schedule for that specific project.
