    description: |
      With GitLab 13.11, if you are a project member, you can now cherry-pick commits from downstream forks back into your project. We've added a new **Pick into project** section to the cherry-pick dialog, shown when you select **Options > Cherry-pick** on a commit's details page.

      Your community of contributors can contribute to your project, and your team no longer needs to manually download a fork's `.patch` file to pull in good changes from stale or unmaintained forks. 

      Future enhancements include [cherry-picking commits from fork to fork](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/326771).
