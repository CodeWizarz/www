        You use the GitLab Package Registry to publish and share generic package files. You can do this using the command line, but it's likely that you use GitLab CI/CD to publish most of your files.

        Prior to GitLab 13.11, the GitLab validation on the file name prevented you from uploading a package with a semantic version (SemVer). This blocked many of you from using the Package Registry in your pipelines since SemVer is commonly used to mark files as related to a given release or branch.

        GitLab 13.11 relaxes the file name validation so you can use SemVer to name files. We hope this helps you to adopt the Package Registry and makes it easier to name, validate, and verify your generic packages.
