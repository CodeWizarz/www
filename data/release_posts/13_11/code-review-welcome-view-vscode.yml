      Getting started with the GitLab Workflow extension for Visual Studio Code (VS Code) requires several manual steps to connect it to GitLab. If the extension isn't set up correctly, or you're setting it up for the first time, it can be hard to verify you've configured it correctly.

      In the GitLab Workflow pane inside VS Code, there are now steps to help you get started. It also tells you if your current workspace doesn't contain a GitLab project.
