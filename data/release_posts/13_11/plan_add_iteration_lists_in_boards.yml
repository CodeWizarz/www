    description: |
      Boards now support creating iteration lists. Quickly move issues from one [iteration](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/iterations/) to another on your planning board or [enable epic swimlanes](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issue_board.html#group-issues-in-swimlanes) to efficiently sequence an epic's issues across your upcoming iterations.
