      The GitLab Agent for Kubernetes is finally available on GitLab.com. By using the Agent, you can benefit from fast, pull-based deployments to your cluster, while GitLab.com manages the necessary server-side components of the Agent. The Agent is the core building block of GitLab's Kubernetes integrations. The Agent-based integration today supports pull-based deployments and Network Security policy integration and alerts, and will soon receive support for push-based deployments too.

      Unlike the legacy, certificate-based Kubernetes integration, the Agent does not require opening up your cluster towards GitLab and allows fine-tuned RBAC controls around GitLab's capabilities within your clusters.
