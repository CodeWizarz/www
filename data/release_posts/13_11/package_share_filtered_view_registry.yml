      description: |
        You use the GitLab Package and Container registries to publish and share your project's dependencies. When you view your registry in GitLab, you can filter and sort the results to find and validate the item you are looking for.

        Before GitLab 13.11, you had no way to share a filtered view of the registry with your teammates. As a result, each team member had to spend time filtering their view. This was inefficient and introduced the risk that the wrong dependency may be installed.

        In GitLab 13.11, you can share your filtered view of the registry by simply copying the URL from your browser and sharing it with your team. We hope this change makes you more efficient.
