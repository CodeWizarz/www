    description: |
      Up to this point in time, if you were using GitLab self-managed, you could use the [release CLI](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release-cli) with a public certificate, but not your own custom one. In GitLab 13.11, we have added support for custom certificate authority (CA) certificates by using the `ADDITIONAL_CA_CERT_BUNDLE` environment variable or the `--additional-ca-cert-bundle` flag. In addition, the `INSECURE_HTTPS` environment variable and the `--insecure-https` flag were added so that the client can skip verifying the server certificates, which would normally fail with a custom SSL certificate because it is not signed by a public CA.
