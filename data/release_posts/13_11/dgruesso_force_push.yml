    description: |
      It's best practice to prevent `force push` on Git repos, but exceptional cases may occasionally require it. Temporarily removing branch protections in order to conduct a `force push` may not always be ideal as it requires maintainer access, and causes the settings for branch protection to be lost.

      GitLab 13.11 introduces a new **Allow force push** setting for protected branches, which enables users in the **Allowed to push** list to force push.
