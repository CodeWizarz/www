  description: |
   Some users are pulling data from the [`list project deployments`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/deployments.html#list-project-deployments) API endpoint to populate a custom-built dashboard. There is no way to restrict the API results to display only the latest changes. To overcome this, one must retrieve all records, check one-by-one and process only the records updated after the latest `updated_at` value in the last batch retrieved. In order to make this process more efficient and performant, this API will change in GitLab 14.0. Using the `updated_after` and `updated_before` in this API will result in an error. These fields will be replaced by 'finished_after' and 'finished_before. In addition, when the 'updated_at' filter is specified, 'order_by' must be 'updated_at'.
