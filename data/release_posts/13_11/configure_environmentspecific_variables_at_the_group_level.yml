    description: |
      Many organizations prefer to specify secrets and other environment variables at the group level, as it aligns well with team boundaries or trust levels. Until now, the group-level environment variables affected all the environments, and this limited their usability in a lot of use cases. Today, we are releasing environment-specific variables at the group level.
      
      This change complements similar functionality at the project level. From now on, group maintainers can specify the environments where a given variable is to be applied.
