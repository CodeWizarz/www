      description: 
          The DevOps adoption table is a valuable feature for leadership to see which GitLab stages and features have been adopted by their teams. Up until this point, this feature could only be accessed through the Admin Area, which restricted access to administrators on self-managed instances of GitLab. This update brings DevOps adoption metrics to the group level, allowing more users to understand how and where they are adopting features across GitLab. This feature is currently disabled by default. To enable it, see [instructions in the documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/devops_adoption/index.html#enable-or-disable-group-devops-adoption). It will be enabled by default in the next release.
