- feature_name: "External Pipeline Validation Service Code Changes"
  due: Jun 22, 2020
  reporter: jreporter
  description: |
    GitLab sends a POST request to the external service URL with the pipeline data as payload. GitLab then invalidates the pipeline based on the response code. If thereâ€™s an error or the request times out, the pipeline is not invalidated. We are changing what codes are accepted:  
        
200: Accepted
4XX: Not accepted
All other codes: accepted and logged
