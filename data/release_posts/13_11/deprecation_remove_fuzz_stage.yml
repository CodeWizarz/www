deprecations:
- feature_name: "All CI/CD stages removed from the fuzz testing default template"

  description: |
    In GitLab 14.0, the stages defined in the current `API-Fuzzing.gitlab-ci.yml` template
    will be removed to avoid the situation where the template overrides manual changes
    made by users of fuzz testing. This change is being made in response to customer issues where
    the stages in the template caused problems when used with customized fuzz testing configurations.
    Because of this removal, `.gitlab-ci.yml` configurations that do not specify a fuzz stage must be updated to include this stage.

    In GitLab 13.11, the stages are deprecated so they've been removed from the `API-Fuzzing.latest.gitlab-ci.yml` template.
    Anyone can test and see if any changes are needed in their configuration files.
