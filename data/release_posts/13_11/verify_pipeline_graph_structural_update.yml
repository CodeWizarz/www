    In this release, you will notice an update to the pipeline graph view that improves performance and maintainability by simplifying the layout. In 13.11, the lines between jobs dependencies that were previously shown will not be displayed, which helps you to more quickly visualize your pipelines. We are also working to add more ways to visualize your pipelines in future releases.
