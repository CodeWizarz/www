        You have two options when downloading Composer dependencies: `source` or `dist`. For stable versions, Composer uses `dist` by default and downloads the dependency as a `zip` file. However, you can also download it directly from version control. If `--prefer-source` is enabled, Composer downloads your dependency as a Git clone instead of as a packaged `zip` file. This is useful if you want to make a bug fix for a project and get a local Git clone of the dependency directly.

        Until recently, you could not use the `prefer-source` and related `preferred-install` commands and configurations when downloading Composer dependencies. This prevented many of you from using the GitLab Package Registry for your Composer dependencies.

        We are happy to announce that you can now download your Composer dependencies from source. Do so by simply adding the `prefer-source` option to your install command like this: `composer update --prefer-source`.
