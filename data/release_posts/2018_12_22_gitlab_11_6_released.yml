        Building on the [Knative integration introduced in GitLab 11.5](/releases/2018/11/22/gitlab-11-5-released/#easily-deploy-and-integrate-knative-with-gitlab), our new
        Serverless capability allows users to easily define functions in
        their repository and have them served and managed by Knative.

        By simply defining your function data in the repo's `serverless.yml`
        file and using a `.gitlab-ci.yml` template, each function will be deployed to your cluster, with Knative
        taking care of scaling your function based on request volume. This will
        allow application developers to iterate quickly without
        having to worry about provisioning or managing infrastructure.

      description: |
        Running a given job only when dealing with a merge request is now easy.
        Using the `merge_requests` value with `only/except` keywords will allow
        you to configure jobs to run only (or except) when in the context of a
        merge request. This allows finer control over pipeline behavior, and
        also allows access to new environment variables indicating the target
        branch and merge request ID when relevant, offering opportunities for
        implementation of other more advanced behaviors.

        Collaborating on merge requests is now easier – no more copy/pasting to
        accept a suggested change. Changes can now be suggested when leaving a
        comment on a merge request diff and accepted with a single click.

        Changes can be suggested when commenting on a diff in a merge request,
        and accepted by any user with write permissions to the source branch.

        This feature is available on GitLab.com today, and can be enabled
        for self-managed GitLab instances using the `diff_suggestions` [feature
        flag](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/features.html). It will be

      description: |
        The Web IDE makes it faster and easier to contribute changes and resolve
        merge request feedback by eliminating the need to stash changes and
        switch branches locally. Yet, without a terminal to run tests,
        experiment in a REPL, or compile your code, making large changes is
        difficult.

        From the Web IDE, you can now launch a Web Terminal so that you can work
        in an editor side by side with a terminal, just like you would locally, to
        inspect API responses or check your syntax in a REPL. The Web Terminal
        is the first server-side evaluation feature of the Web IDE and is
        configured using a new `.gitlab/.gitlab-webide.yml` file.

        Interactive Web Terminals are not yet available on GitLab.com. You can
        follow progress
        [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/52611).
        Changes are not currently synchronized between the editor and the web
        terminal. In an upcoming release, we will add support for [mirroring
        changes](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/5276) and [live
        preview](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/4013).

        Project templates help you bootstrap new projects quickly. In
        [11.2](/releases/2018/08/22/gitlab-11-2-released/#custom-project-templates-on-the-instance-level),
        we introduced project templates on the
        [instance level](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/48043).

        With GitLab 11.6, we are happy to announce this functionality is now
        available for groups as well. By creating a sub-group within a new group
        setting, projects in this sub-group become available as templates. This
        streamlines the setup and ensures consistency across your projects,
        especially in larger group structures, such as microservice architectures.

        Often, development teams working on related projects
        need to use the same Kubernetes cluster to deploy their
        applications. Starting with GitLab 11.6, users are able to create a
        group-level Kubernetes cluster that can be used for all projects
        contained within the group or sub-groups.

        This will greatly reduce the time/effort required to configure infrastructure
        for your projects and allow you to focus on developing great
        applications.

        Cert-manager is a Kubernetes-native certificate management controller
        that will automatically issue and renew SSL certificates using Let's
        Encrypt.

        Using this SSL certificate will enable HTTPS for applications
        served via Auto DevOps as well as for JupyterHub deployments.

        The [Group Security
        Dashboard](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/security_dashboard/) is
        the primary tool where Security professionals can manage vulnerabilities
        in their projects. One of the most important requirements is to know how the
        number of vulnerabilities is changing day by day, and understand if the
        team is solving problems quickly enough.

        With GitLab 11.6, the Vulnerability Chart for Group Security
        Dashboards enables you to easily view the graph of vulnerabilities from
        the last month. For each severity level, you can read values for
        vulnerabilities and move over the chart to see more details
        about a specific point in time.

        YubiKeys or Common Access Cards), GitLab now supports local user
        creation and login.

        Users can now use hardware tokens to access GitLab, increasing security and
        avoiding the need for managing username/password credentials not
        connected to a physical token.

        Software development is a creative process involving the whole team, and
        ideas should be welcome from everyone. Ideas that emerge as issues can now
        freely flow up into epics with the new issue promotion feature.

        You can now promote an issue to an epic simply by using a new
        [quick action](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/quick_actions.html).
        Just type `/promote` in a comment on the issue and hit **Comment**. This will
        close the issue, and copy over the content of the issue into a new epic,
        in the immediate parent group of the issue's project. Labels,
        participants, and even upvotes/downvotes will be copied over to the

        We recently introduced the ability to close epics, as a way to indicate
        that an epic is finished or no longer relevant.

        With this release, we're providing the option to view open epics,
        closed epics, or both on the roadmap view. This is helpful for
        teams that want to focus just on remaining and upcoming work (open
        epics), that want to review finished work (closed epics), or see
        recently finished work in conjunction with current work (both). This
        feature provides that flexibility. Additionally, your selection is saved
        to the system per user, so next time you return to a roadmap view, it
        will be what you have selected previously.

        In 11.0, we introduced unlimited guest users for Ultimate plans.

        We're extending this to Gold plans, so groups using GitLab.com's highest
        plan, whether self-managed or cloud SaaS, can benefit from adding guests at no additional cost.

        For some organizations, allowing admin impersonation presents a security
        risk since the actions of administrators are attributed to the user
        they are impersonating. In order to address this, we're adding a
        configurable option to disable admin impersonations.

        Front matter is metadata included at the beginning of a markdown document,
        often used by static site generators such as [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/)
        and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/). When GitLab displays
        markdown files in repositories as rendered HTML, front matter retains its format and is displayed as-is, for clarity.

        In addition to YAML front matter delimeters (`---`), GitLab now also supports TOML delimiters (`+++`), JSON
        delimiters (`;;;`), and arbitrary delimiters, enabling the support of any data format.

        In [GitLab
        11.5](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2018/11/22/gitlab-11-5-released/#group-security-dashboard)
        we released the [Group Security
        Dashboard](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/security_dashboard/)
        where
        [SAST](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/)
        results are displayed.

        With 11.6, we update the [Auto
        DevOps](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/autodevops/) template with the
        latest version of the [SAST
        job](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/) definition, and
        now results are fully compatible with the Group Security Dashboard, so
        users can enjoy both features at the same time.

        **Note:** The new SAST job definition requires [GitLab
        Runner](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/) 11.5 or above, you can read
        more details in this [blog
        post](/blog/2018/12/06/gitlab-runner-update-required-to-use-auto-devops-and-sast/).

        - Postgres is now installed in a directory under its major version name, so updates within a major version no longer require a restart of the database.
        - GitLab now supports [connecting to Redis over SSL (rediss://)](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/redis.html#using-secure-sockets-layer-ssl).
        - The `omnibus-gitlab` container image's sshd config now supports Git Protocol v2 by default.
        - GitLab 11.6 includes [Mattermost 5.5](https://mattermost.com/blog/mattermost-5-5-web-conferencing-integration-hacktoberfest-contributions-and-more/), an [open source Slack-alternative](https://mattermost.com/) whose newest release includes several bug fixes and performance improvements.
        - `postgres` has been updated to 9.6.11, `ruby` to 2.5.3, `docker-distribution` with a partial set of 2.7.0 commits.

        We continue to improve the performance of GitLab with every release,
        for GitLab instances of every size.

        In GitLab 11.6 we have significantly reduced the memory usage of the
        `ReactiveCaching` worker by switching to Nokogiri for XML parsing, and we've
        halved the compressed payload size of the merge request discussions
        endpoint.

        These and other noteworthy performance improvements include:

        - [Improve the rendering performance of new and current merge request discussions by reducing the number of dependencies on each discussion object](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/22935)
        - [Improve merge request discussions endpoint size by removing unused data](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/23570)
        - [Improve performance of projects API by removing N+1 RPC calls to get readme_url](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/23357)
        - [Improve performance of issue boards on first load](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/23324)
        - [Improve performance of `ReactiveCaching` worker by changing XML parser](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/23136)

        The chart shows the reduction in memory usage by the `ReactiveCaching`
        worker since deploying GitLab 11.6 to GitLab.com.

    Suzanne assisted GitLab in performing our recent
    [Voluntary Product Accessibility Template](https://design.gitlab.com/accessibility/vpat) (VPAT)
    review by organizing and verifying open accessibility issues, as well as
    helping to assess the current state of the product through static analysis
    tools and manual testing with assistive technologies. The VPAT evaluates
    compliance with accessibility standards and is a great first step towards
    improving accessibility so that everyone can contribute and use GitLab!

    Thank you, Suzanne! We appreciate your contribution that enables more people to use GitLab.

    To upgrade to GitLab 11.6 from the latest 11.5 version, no downtime is
    required for multi-node/HA deployments. To upgrade without downtime,
    please consult the [documentation on downtimeless
    upgrades](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/update/#upgrading-without-downtime).

    Due to the [`ruby` upgrade](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/update/gitlab_11_changes.html#116),
    a single GitLab node will be down until the `unicorn` processes have been restarted. The
    restart is done automatically at the end of `gitlab-ctl reconfigure`, which is run
    by default on upgrade.

    For this release we have migrations, post-deploy migrations, and to help
    with the larger migrations, we have introduced background migrations.

    GitLab.com migrations took approximately 25 minutes and post-deploy
    migrations amounted for a total of around 2 minutes. Background migrations
    on the other hand are sidekiq jobs that will run synchronously. For this
    release these migrations took around 15 minutes to complete, and no side effects
    were expected nor present.

    GitLab Geo users, please consult the documentation on [upgrading
    Geo](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/geo/replication/updating_the_geo_nodes.html).

deprecations:
  - feature_name: "Ruby 2.5 required"

    reporter: stanhu
    description: |
      Beginning with GitLab 11.6, Ruby 2.5 is required to run
      GitLab. [Omnibus GitLab already ships with Ruby 2.5.3](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/merge_requests/2806),
      but users of source installations that run Ruby 2.4 will have to upgrade.

  - feature_name: "GitLab Geo will enforce Hashed Storage in GitLab 12.0"
    due: Mar. 22, 2019.
    reporter: mkozono
    description: |
      GitLab Geo requires [Hashed
      Storage](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/repository_storage_types.html#hashed-storage)
       to mitigate race conditions on Geo secondaries. This was noted in
      [gitlab-ce#40970](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/40970).

      In 11.5, we added this requirement to the Geo documentation:
      [gitlab-ee#8053](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/8053).

      With 11.6, `sudo gitlab-rake gitlab:geo:check` checks that Hashed
      Storage is enabled and all projects are migrated:
      [gitlab-ee#8289](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/8289). If
      you are using Geo, please run this check and migrate as soon as possible.

      In 11.7, we will add a dismissable warning that will be displayed on
      the "Admin Area › Geo › Nodes" page.

      In 12.0, Geo will enforce the Hashed Storage requirement:
      [gitlab-ee#8690](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/8690).

  - feature_name: "Support for Prometheus 1.x in Omnibus GitLab"
    due: GitLab 12.0
    reporter: joshlambert
    description: |
      With GitLab 11.4 (Oct. 22, 2018) the bundled Prometheus 1.0 version is
      deprecated in Omnibus GitLab. [Prometheus 2.0 is now
      included](#prometheus-20-upgrade-for-omnibus-gitlab), however the metrics
      format is incompatible with 1.0. Existing installations can upgrade to 2.0
      and optionally migrate their data [using an included
      tool](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/update/gitlab_11_changes.html#11-4).

      With GitLab 12.0 any installation not yet running Prometheus 2.0 will be
      automatically upgraded. Metric data from Prometheus 1.0 will not be
      migrated, and will be lost.

  - feature_name: "TLS v1.1 will be disabled by default in 12.0"
    due: GitLab 12.0
    reporter: joshlambert
    description: |
      Beginning with GitLab 12.0, [TLS v1.1 will be disabled by default](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/update/gitlab_11_changes.html#tls-v11-deprecation)
      to improve security. This mitigates numerous issues including Heartbleed
      and makes GitLab compliant out of the box with the PCI DSS 3.1 standard.

      To disable TLS v1.1 immediately, set `nginx['ssl_protocols'] = "TLSv1.2"` in
      `gitlab.rb` and run `gitlab-ctl reconfigure`.
