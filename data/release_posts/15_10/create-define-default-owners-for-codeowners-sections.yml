    description: |
      Define a default code owner for each section of your `CODEOWNERS` file. This default
      now applies to files and directories referenced in the section. This way you don't
      have to repeat the same owners over and over. Individual files and directories can
      still be overridden.

      In this example, all files and directories are owned by `@dev-team`, except `README.md`
      and the `data-models/` directory.
