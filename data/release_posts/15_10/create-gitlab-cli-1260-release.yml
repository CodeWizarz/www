        The v1.26.0 release of the GitLab CLI brings two great new features for working with GitLab CI/CD:

          - [Sebastian Gumprich](https://gitlab.com/rndmh3ro) contributed the ability to [run pipeline schedules](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli/-/issues/1237).
          - [madflow](https://gitlab.com/madflow) contributed an [export function for CI/CD variables](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli/-/issues/1218) in both projects and groups.

        There are also many improvements to existing commands, and documentation improvements to help both SaaS and self-managed users to get started. For a full list of changes, see [the release notes](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli/-/releases/v1.26.0).

        Thank you Sebastian and madflow for your contributions!
