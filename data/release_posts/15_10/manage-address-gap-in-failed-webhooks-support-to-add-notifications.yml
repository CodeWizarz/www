    description: |
      To protect GitLab and users across the system from any potential abuse or misuse, we've implemented a feature to disable group webhooks that fail consistently.

      - Group webhooks that return response codes in the `5xx` range are understood to be failing intermittently and are temporarily disabled. These webhooks are initially disabled for 1 minute, which is extended on each retry up to a maximum of 24 hours.
      - Group webhooks that fail with `4xx` errors are permanently disabled.

      Users with the Owner or Maintainer role are alerted in the app to investigate and re-enable any failed group webhooks.

      By default, this feature is enabled on GitLab.com and disabled on self-managed GitLab. To enable automated disabling of failed webhooks for project or group webhooks, administrators of self-managed instances must enable the `auto_disabling_web_hooks` [feature flag](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/feature_flags.html).
