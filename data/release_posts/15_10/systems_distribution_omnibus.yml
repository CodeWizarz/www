        - GitLab 15.10 includes [Mattermost 7.8](https://mattermost.com/blog/mattermost-v7-8-is-now-available/) with updates to Boards filters and groups, and more. This version also includes [security updates](https://mattermost.com/security-updates/) and upgrading from earlier versions is recommended. For more information, [read the upgrade notes](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/mattermost/#upgrading-gitlab-mattermost-to-1510).
        - In GitLab 15.10, we also introduce new public [version manifests](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/omnibus-gitlab/gitlab-manifests/manifests.html) for Omnibus GitLab. The version manifest file shows the top level software versions, and importantly, where those versions can be fetched from. These files may need to be readily available for different cloud-deploy requirements, so now our release pipelines will generate a public manifest version.
