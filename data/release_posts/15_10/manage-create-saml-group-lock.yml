    description: |
      SAML group lock allows GitLab administrators to prevent additional members being added to groups that are controlled by SAML group links. Previously, if SSO enforcement was enabled, a group Owner could add a non-group user to their group if that user has signed in using SSO. If SSO enforcement was not enabled, a group Owner could add any non-group user to their group. Now, if SAML group lock is enabled, users can only be added using SAML group links.
