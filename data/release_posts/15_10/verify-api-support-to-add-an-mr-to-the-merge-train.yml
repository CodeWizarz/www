    description: |
      Merge Trains allow you to sequence merge requests (MRs) and verify their changes work together before they are merged to the target branch. Previously, to add an MR to a merge train, you had to click a button on the MR's page in the GitLab UI. This method did not support CI/CD automation or other flows that some organizations might want to implement. 
      
      Now you can add a merge request to a merge train by using the merge trains API, enabling more control through automation.
