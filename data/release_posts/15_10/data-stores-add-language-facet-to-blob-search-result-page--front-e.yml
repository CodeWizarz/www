    description: "You can now filter code search results by one or more languages. The new filter uses Elasticsearch aggregations to help you narrow down the results to specific programming languages. To use this feature, [Advanced Search must be enabled](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/search/advanced_search.html#enable-advanced-search)."
