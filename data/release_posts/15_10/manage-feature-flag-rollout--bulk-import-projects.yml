    description: |
       The [open beta release of migrating GitLab projects](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2023/01/18/try-out-new-way-to-migrate-projects/) with
       top-level groups by direct transfer meant GitLab self-managed users gained access to the beta feature. However, instance administrators had
       to enable both:

       - An application setting for migrating groups.
       - The `bulk_import_projects` feature flag for migrating projects in the groups.

       In this release, we have removed the feature flag so you only need the [application setting](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/settings/visibility_and_access_controls.html#enable-migration-of-groups-and-projects-by-direct-transfer).

       This change also enables GitLab Dedicated instances to take advantage of the feature.
