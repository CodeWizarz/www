      description: |
        GitLab Dependency Scanning now supports a new `DS_MAX_DEPTH` variable to allow users to scan their entire repository for lock files. This variable defaults to only scanning up to two directories deep by default; however, users can set the variable to a larger number or to a value of `-1` to scan their entire repository.
