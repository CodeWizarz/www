      Until now, imported GitHub projects didn't have their collaborators imported with them. This meant that no users had any
      permissions on these projects. As a workaround, group owners would add members before the import.

      Now, if a collaborator's role can be mapped to a GitLab role, GitLab adds the GitHub collaborator to the imported project as a GitLab project member.
