    description: |
      Previously, you had to use a time-based one-time password (TOTP) before you could add a WebAuthn device as a two-factor authentication (2FA) method on your GitLab account. Now, you can add a WebAuthn device as your 2FA method without having to use a TOTP. You must download recovery codes when adding a WebAuthn device as your 2FA method so you can recover access to your account if you are locked out.
