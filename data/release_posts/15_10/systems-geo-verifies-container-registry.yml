    description: |
      With this release, Geo now automatically verifies the data integrity of a replicated [Container Registry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/container_registry/). This ensures that container images are not corrupted in transfer or at rest. If Geo is used as part of a disaster recovery strategy, this protects you against data loss.
