    description: |
      From GitLab 15.10, you can configure and validate your projects with Apple App Store credentials. You can then use those credentials in CI/CD pipelines to automate releases to Test Flight and the App Store.

      To record your experiences with the App Store integration, see this [feedback issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/incubation-engineering/mobile-devops/feedback/-/issues/10).
