    description: |
      This release includes a new section dedicated to browsing and discovering various content within GitLab. This new section, called **Explore**, helps you view and search across different content types. Previously, it was difficult to switch between types while searching for content. 
      
      Also with this change, the **Topics** section is elevated to the **Explore** section. This change should better accommodate the feature and its discoverability. This change helps promote open source while helping you find content related to topics you are interested in.
