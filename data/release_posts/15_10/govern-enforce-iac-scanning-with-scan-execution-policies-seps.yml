    description: "Users can now require SAST IaC scans to run on a regular schedule
      or as part of project CI pipelines, independent of the `.gitlab-ci.yml` fileâ€™s
      contents. This allows security teams to manage these scan requirements separately,
      without allowing developers to change the configuration. You can get started
      by creating a scan execution policy on the **Security & Compliance > Policies**
      page."
