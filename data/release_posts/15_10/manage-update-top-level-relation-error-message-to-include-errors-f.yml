    description: |
      When migrating GitLab groups and projects, errors listed as import failures on the group **Import history** page were not always informative enough.

      We now include errors from all nested subrelations to make it clear why a relation (for example, a merge request), failed to import. Better error
      messages support debugging and speed up resolution time.
