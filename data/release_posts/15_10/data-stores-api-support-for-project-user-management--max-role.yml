    description: |
      Users with the Owner or Maintainer role for a project can now use the GraphQL API to change the maximum access level of non-inherited users of a project. This release brings more administrative features to users with the Owner or Maintainer role for projects on GitLab.com, and lays the foundation for future administrative bulk actions.
