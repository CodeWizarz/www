    description: |
      To improve the tracking of development workflows in Value Stream Analytics, we added a new pairing rule for customizable stages between MR label events and MR merged events. This rule makes it possible to create a custom stage that, for example, measures the time from when an MR was labeled as `workflow::in review` to when it was merged.
