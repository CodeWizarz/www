    description: |
      GitLab SAST now automatically [resolves](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/vulnerabilities/#vulnerability-status-values) vulnerabilities from the [Semgrep](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/semgrep)- and [KICS](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/kics)-based analyzers when either:

      - You [disable a predefined rule](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/customize_rulesets.html#disable-predefined-rules).
      - We remove a rule from the default ruleset.

      This change helps you focus on the vulnerabilities that are still relevant after the rule update.
      Previously, when a rule was no longer scanned, its findings would be marked ["No longer detected"](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/vulnerability_report/#activity-filter) but you still had to take action to resolve them.
      Now, the Vulnerability Management system automatically resolves those findings and leaves a comment explaining that the rule was removed, so you still have a historical record of the vulnerability.

      This change will automatically resolve findings from a small number of rules that we've replaced or removed in recent releases.
      In this release, we've also [removed a JavaScript SAST rule](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/373920) that created too many false-positive results.

      This feature is enabled by default on GitLab.com and in GitLab 15.10.
      On GitLab.com, [contact Support](/support/) if you need to disable the flag for your project.
      On GitLab self-managed, you can [disable the project-level feature flag](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/feature_flags.html) named `sec_mark_dropped_findings_as_resolved`.
