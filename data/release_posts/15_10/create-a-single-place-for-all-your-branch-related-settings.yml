      All branch-related protections now display on a single page. To see a unified list of your branches and all their protection methods, go to **Settings > Repository > Branch rules**. Each branch shows the merge request approvals, security approvals, protected branches, and status checks configured for it. Previously, these settings were grouped by type, making it tough to see a holistic view of a specific branch's protections.

      We hope this change helps you discover, use, and monitor these settings more easily. We'd love your feedback [in issue #388149](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/388149).
