    description: |
      The GitLab Agent for Kubernetes allows a secure bi-directional connection between GitLab and any Kubernetes cluster.
      Until now, registering a new Kubernetes Agent required writing GraphQL queries.

      As of GitLab 14.2, GitLab ships with a user-friendly user interface and a registration form to help you get started with the Kubernetes Agent with ease.
