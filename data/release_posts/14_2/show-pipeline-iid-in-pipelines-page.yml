    description: |
      The pipeline IID gives the internal ID of a pipeline relative to the project that triggered it, and it increments for every new pipeline in the project. The pipeline IID increments much slower than the pipeline ID, which increments by one for every pipeline in the whole GitLab instance. This makes the pipeline IID a more useful value for use cases like versioning project releases based on pipelines, tracking pipelines based on their run order in the project, project pipeline metrics, etc.

      To help improve the experience of using the pipeline IID, we are adding an option to the pipelines page to change the display from the ID, to the internal project IID. Now you can easily see which pipeline matches the IIDs you are using.
