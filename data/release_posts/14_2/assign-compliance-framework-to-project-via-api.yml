    description: |
      You can now set a compliance framework for projects using the GraphQL API
      in addition to the [GitLab UI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/settings/index.html#compliance-frameworks).
      This makes it easy to do bulk updates to many projects at once and supports those who
      prefer to create and configure projects programmatically.
