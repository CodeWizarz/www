    description: |
      The GitLab managed Terraform state can be accessed from GitLab
      CI/CD without any special configuration. To access the same state from a local
      machine, Terraform must be initialized with several parameters.

      Finding the right parameters can be a tedious and error-prone process, so we now provide a
      simple user interface on the Terraform State list page
      that shows the command to use to initialize a Terraform state access from the command
      line. You can access this view from the **Infrastructure > Terraform** menu.
