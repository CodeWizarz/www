    description: |
      In GitLab 13.10, we introduced the concept of [deployment tier](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/environments/#deployment-tier-of-environments). In this release, we added `deployment_tier` in the [Pipeline events webhook](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/webhooks.html#pipeline-events) so that you can use it in your automations.
