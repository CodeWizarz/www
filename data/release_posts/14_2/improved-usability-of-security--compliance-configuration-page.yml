    description: |
      GitLab has greatly expanded Security and Compliance functionality
      over the last year. As features have grown, so have the number of related configuration
      options. The current Security & Compliance Configuration page has expanded beyond
      what it was originally designed to accommodate, making finding the right option
      cumbersome.

      To address this, we have redesigned the Security & Compliance
      Configuration page. Not only does the new design improve usability, it provides a
      flexible pattern that will scale as we continue to add to our security and compliance
      offerings.
