    description: |
      In a previous release, we added a new [banned user](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/moderate_users.html#ban-and-unban-users) state. In this release, we now also hide all issues created by a banned user. This is extremely helpful in cases where a malicious user bombards GitLab instances with spam issues. These can now be hidden.
