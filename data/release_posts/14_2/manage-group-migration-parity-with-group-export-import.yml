      The new [GitLab Migration](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/import/) feature can now migrate an entire group with all its subgroups and related data. The data migrated includes everything contained in [group exports](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/settings/import_export.html), making this a much easier way to migrate entire groups. 
      The pre-existing group import/export is a two-step process that requires exporting a file and then importing it into another GitLab instance.

      Now, users can initiate a group migration with a single click. Migration also includes all the subgroups and their data, which previously required separate export and import processes for each subgroup.
