    description: |
      Previously, the **Secret** field was visible in the GitLab UI on an application's configuration page. To improve security, we have hidden this field from the UI and added a **Copy** button. You can then copy the secret and store it in a secured location. This makes sure the secret is not visible in clear text for anyone looking at the screen.
