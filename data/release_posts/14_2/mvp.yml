    Cornelius [added support](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/43352)
    for opening code changes directly in Gitpod when viewing a merge request. In fact, this
    release blog post was created and edited with Gitpod! Cornelius initially helped add an
    option to open a project in Gitpod to the repository overview page in [GitLab 13.5](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/10/22/gitlab-13-5-released/#launch-gitpod-workspaces-directly-from-gitlab).

    That capability has now expanded so that you can launch Gitpod directly from the merge
    request page to speed up your reviews and reduce the need for context switching in your
    local development environment.

    Read the [full release post](#launch-a-preconfigured-gitpod-workspace-from-a-merge-request) below for more details. Thanks for your contributions
    Cornelius! We believe cloud development environments like Gitpod reduce barriers and make
    it easier for [everyone to contribute](https://about.gitlab.com/company/mission/#everyone-can-contribute).
