    description: |
      You can now use variables as part of `include` statements in `.gitlab-ci.yml` files. These variables can
      be instance, group, or project CI/CD variables.
      
      This improvement provides you with more flexibility to define pipelines. You can copy the same `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to multiple projects and use variables to alter its behavior. This allows for less duplication in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file and reduces the need for complicated per-project configuration.
