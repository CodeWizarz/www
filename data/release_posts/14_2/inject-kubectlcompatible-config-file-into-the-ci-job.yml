    description: |
      Until now, users of the GitLab Agent for Kubernetes CI/CD Tunnel had to add
      a corresponding `kubeconfig` configuration file to a CI/CD job manually. Creating the 
      `kubeconfig` file required editing the CI/CD pipeline definition, a knowledge of the Agent
      ID, and an understanding of how a `kubeconfig` is structured. It also introduced
      boilerplate code into the CI/CD pipeline definition.

      GitLab now injects a `kubeconfig` file that contains all the available agent connections for
      the given project. A user only has to choose the right `kubecontext` to use.
