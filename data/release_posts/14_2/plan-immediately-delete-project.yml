    description: |
      Delayed project removal protects your data by placing deleted projects in a read-only state so you can restore them. Until now, [delayed project deletion](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/#enable-delayed-project-removal) has been disabled on GitLab.com because there has been no way to immediately delete a project when necessary.

      In this release, we've added an instance setting to enable delayed deletion by default for all new projects. You can also immediately permanently delete projects that are scheduled for delayed deletion without globally disabling the setting.

      Delayed project deletion is now enabled by default for new groups and projects created on GitLab.com, and group owners can disable it.
