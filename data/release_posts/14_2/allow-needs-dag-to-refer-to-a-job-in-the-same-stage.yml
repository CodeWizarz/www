    description: |
      Using the [`needs`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#needs) keyword in your pipeline configuration helps to reduce cycle times by ignoring stage ordering and running jobs without waiting for others to complete. Previously, `needs` could only be used between jobs on different stages.

      In this release, we've removed this limitation so you can define a `needs` relationship between any job you want. As a result, you can now create a complete CI/CD pipeline without using stages by including `needs` in every job to implicitly configure the execution order. This lets you define a less verbose pipeline that takes less time to create and can run even faster.
