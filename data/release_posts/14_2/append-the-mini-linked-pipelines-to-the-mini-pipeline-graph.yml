    description: |
      The pipeline mini graph shows you the status of each stage in your pipeline and gives you a quick and easy way to navigate to any job. Linking multiple pipeline mini graphs together provides you with the same functionality for related upstream and downstream pipelines.

      In this release, you have the ability to see linked upstream and downstream pipelines in the mini graph in new areas in the GitLab UI: the pipeline tab, the project pipeline page, the commit page, and the commit page's pipeline tab.
