    description: |
      In this release we are excited to announce the availability of CI/CD components, as an experimental feature. A CI/CD component is a reusable single-purpose building block that can be used to compose a part of a project's CI/CD configuration, or even an entire pipeline.

      When combined with the [`inputs`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/includes.html#define-inputs-for-configuration-added-with-include-beta) keyword, a CI/CD component can be made much more flexible. You can configure the component to your exact needs by inputting values which can be used for job names, variables, credentials, and so on.
