      Code Suggestions is now available on GitLab.com for all users for free while the feature is in Beta. Teams can
      boost efficiency with the help of generative AI that suggests code while you're developing.

      We've extended language support from our initial six languages to now include 13 languages: C/C++, C#, Go, Java,
      JavaScript, Python, PHP, Ruby, Rust, Scala, Kotlin, and TypeScript.
      
      We are making improvements to the Code Suggestions underlying AI model weekly to improve the quality of suggestions.
      Please remember that AI is non-deterministic, so you may not get the same suggestion week to week.

      Read more about these [improvements and what's next](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2023/05/16/code-suggestions-for-all-during-beta/).
