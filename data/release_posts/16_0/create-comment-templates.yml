        When you're commenting in issues, epics, or merge requests you might repeat yourself and need to write the same comment over and over. Maybe you always need to ask for more information about a bug report. Maybe you're applying labels via a quick action as part of a triage process. Or maybe you just like to finish all your code reviews with a funny gif or appropriate emoji. ðŸŽ‰

        Comment templates enable you to create saved responses that you can apply in comment boxes around GitLab to speed up your workflow. To create a comment template, go to **User settings > Comment templates** and then fill out your template. After it's saved, select the **Insert comment template** icon on any text area, and your saved response will be applied.

        This is a great way to standardize your replies and save you time!
