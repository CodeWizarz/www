      GitLab 16.0 features an all-new navigation experience! To get started, go to your avatar in the top right of the UI and turn on the **New navigation** toggle. The left sidebar changes to a new and improved design, based on user feedback we've received over the last year.

      Please let us know about your experience in [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/409005). Based on the feedback, we will be progressively enabling the new navigation across our user base, with the final step being removal of the old navigation.
