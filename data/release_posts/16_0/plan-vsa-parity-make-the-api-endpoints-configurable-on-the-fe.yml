    description: |
     To improve the visibility into the complete workstream, we are adding to the project-level Value Stream Analytics (VSA) the [Overview stage](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/value_stream_analytics) and the option to [create custom value streams](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/value_stream_analytics/#create-a-value-stream-with-custom-stages).

     Until now, these features were only available at the group-level VSA only.
