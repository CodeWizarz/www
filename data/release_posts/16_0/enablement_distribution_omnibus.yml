      description: |
        - PostgreSQL 12 is no longer supported. The minimum required version is PostgreSQL 13. Users of the packaged PostgreSQL 12 must
          [perform a database upgrade](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/database.html#upgrade-packaged-postgresql-server) before installing GitLab
          16.0.
        - The new base OS for the Omnibus GitLab docker images is Ubuntu 22.04.
        - GitLab 16.0 disables older telemetry endpoints for Consul, which were deprecated in Consul 1.9. This allows us to
          [update Consul to newer versions](https://developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/v1.12.x/agent/config/config-files#telemetry-parameters).
        - GitLab 16.0 includes packages for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 9 and compatible distributions.
        - GitLab 16.0 includes [Mattermost 7.10](https://mattermost.com/) with [security updates](https://mattermost.com/security-updates/). An upgrade from earlier versions is recommended.
