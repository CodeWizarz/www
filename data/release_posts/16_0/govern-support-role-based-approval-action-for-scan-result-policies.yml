    description: |
      With role-based approval actions, you can configure scan result policies to require approval from GitLab-supported roles, including Owners, Maintainers, and Developers.

      This gives you additional flexibility over requiring individual approvers or defined groups of users, making it easier to enforce policies based on roles you already leverage in GitLab, at scale, especially across large organizations.
