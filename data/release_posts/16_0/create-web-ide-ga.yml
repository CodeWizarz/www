    description: |
      Since its introduction, we've been iterating on the usability, performance, and stability of the Web IDE, which
      has enabled us to build features like remote development workspaces and code suggestions on a powerful foundation.

      We have received overwhelmingly positive feedback on the Web IDE Beta and starting in GitLab 16.0, we are making
      it the default multi-file code editor across GitLab.
