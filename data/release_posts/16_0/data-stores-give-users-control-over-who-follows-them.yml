    description: |
      We have received feedback from users who wanted to prevent getting unwanted followers of their user profile. We listened to your concerns, so now, in your user profile settings under Preferences, you can disable following.

      When you disable this feature, no one can follow you, and you cannot follow anyone. All existing following and follower relationships are removed, and the count is set to zero.
