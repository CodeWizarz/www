    description: |
      GitLab Error Tracking, which allows developers to discover and view errors generated by their application, is now generally available on GitLab.com! GitLab error tracking helps to increase efficiency and awareness by surfacing error information directly in the same interface as the code is developed, built, deployed, and released. 
      
      In this release, we are supporting both the [GitLab integrated error tracking](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/operations/error_tracking.html#integrated-error-tracking) and the
      [Sentry-based](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/operations/error_tracking.html#sentry-error-tracking) backends.
