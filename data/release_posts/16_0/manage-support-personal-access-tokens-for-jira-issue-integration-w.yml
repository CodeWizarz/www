    description: |
      Previously, you could only authenticate the [Jira issue integration](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/jira/configure.html) with a Jira username
      and password.

      Now you can use a [Jira personal access token](https://confluence.atlassian.com/enterprise/using-personal-access-tokens-1026032365.html) to authenticate
      if you are using Jira Data Center and Jira Server with Jira 8.14 and later. A Jira personal access token is a safer alternative to a username and password.
