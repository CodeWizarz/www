        - Updates to GitLab 16.0 also update cert-manager to version 1.11.x. This cert-manager update includes breaking changes you must
          [read before upgrading](https://cert-manager.io/docs/release-notes/release-notes-1.10/#breaking-changes-you-must-read-this-before-you-upgrade).
          These changes include a change to container names that was best done during a major release of GitLab. To see details of updated features, see the 
          [releases notes for cert-manager 1.11](https://cert-manager.io/docs/release-notes/release-notes-1.11).
        - PostgreSQL 12 is no longer supported. The minimum required version is PostgreSQL 13, and support for PostgreSQL 14 is added.
          New chart installs of GitLab include PostgreSQL 14 by default, and upgrades must follow the steps for
          [upgrading the bundled PostgreSQL version](https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/installation/database_upgrade.html).
        - Updates to GitLab 16.0 include an update to the Redis subchart to version 16.13.2, including Redis 6.2.7.
        - We have removed the bundled Grafana chart. For more information, see
          [removal of the bundled Grafana Helm chart](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/update/removals.html#bundled-grafana-helm-chart) on our removals page.
          If you use the bundled Grafana, you must switch to the [newer chart version from Grafana Labs](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/grafana/grafana)
          or a Grafana Operator from a trusted provider.
        - GitLab 16.0 includes
          [registry services details for webservice and Sidekiq](https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/charts/globals.html#configure-registry-settings)
          in the `global.registry.*` configuration for simplification because the values are present in both. You can keep the old behavior with an override. 
        - The [minimum supported Helm version](https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/installation/tools.html#helm) is 3.5.2.
        - The GitLab Runner default version is now Ubuntu 22.04.
