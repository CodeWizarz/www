    description: |
      Starting with 16.0, self-managed installations of GitLab will have two database connections by default, instead of
      one. This change makes self-managed versions of GitLab behave similarly to GitLab.com, and is a step towards enabling
      a [separate database for CI features](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7509) for self-managed versions of GitLab.

      This change applies to installation methods with Omnibus GitLab, GitLab Helm chart, GitLab Operator, GitLab Docker images, and installation from source.
