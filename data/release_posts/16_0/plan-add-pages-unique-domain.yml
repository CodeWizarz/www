    description: |
      In previous versions of GitLab, cookies of different GitLab Pages sites under the same top-level group were visible for other projects under the same top-level because of the GitLab Pages default URL format.

      Now, you can secure your sites by assigning a unique subdomain to each GitLab Pages project.
