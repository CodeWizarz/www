    description: |
      The GitLab Package Registry now supports downloading Maven packages using the Scala build tool (`sbt`). Previously, Scala users had no way to download Maven packages from the registry because basic authentication was not supported. As a result, Scala users were either blocked from using the registry or had to use Maven (`mvn`) or Gradle as an alternative.

      By adding support for Scala, we hope to help you use the Package Registry with your more data intensive projects.

      Please note that publishing artifacts using `sbt` is not yet supported, but you can follow [issue 408479](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/408479) if you are interested in adding support for publishing.
