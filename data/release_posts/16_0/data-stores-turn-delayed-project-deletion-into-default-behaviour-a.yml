    description: |
      To prevent accidental deletion of projects and groups, starting in GitLab 16.0, the delayed deletion feature will be turned on by default for all GitLab Ultimate and Premium customers.

      Self-managed users still have the option to define a deletion delay period of between 1 and 90 days, and SaaS users have a non-adjustable default retention period of 7 days.

      Users of Ultimate and Premium groups can still delete a group or project immediately from the group or project settings via a two-step deletion process.

      We believe that this change will contribute to a safer deletion process and will be beneficial in preventing accidental deletions. We'd love your feedback in issue [#396996](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/396996).
