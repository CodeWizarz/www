      description: |
        We are aiming to bring the best practices of DevSecOps to data sciences by providing more powerful compute hardware within GitLab runner.
        Previously, data scientists may have had workloads that were compute-intensive and as a result, jobs may not have been as quickly executed in GitLab.

        Now, with GPU-enabled SaaS runners on Linux, these workloads can be seamlessly supported using GitLab.com.

        So why wait? Try out the new runner today and let us know what you think in this [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/403008). We can't wait to hear your feedback!
