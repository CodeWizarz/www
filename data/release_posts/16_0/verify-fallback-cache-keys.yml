    description: |
      Using a cache is a great way to speed up your pipelines by reusing dependencies that were already fetched in a previous job or pipeline. But when there is no cache yet, the benefits of caching are lost because the job has to start from scratch, fetching every dependency.

      We previously introduced a single fallback cache to use when no cache is found, that you can define globally. This was useful for projects that used a similar cache for all jobs. Now in 16.0 we've improved that feature with per-cache fallback keys. You can define up to 5 fallback keys for every job's cache, greatly reducing the risk that a job runs without a useful cache. If you have a wide variety of caches, you can now use an appropriate fallback cache as needed.
