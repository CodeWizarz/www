    description: |
      You asked, we listened! In our efforts to be best-in-class for CI/CD build speeds, we're doubling the vCPU & RAM for all GitLab SaaS runners on Linux, with no increase in the [cost factor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/cicd_minutes.html#cost-factor).
      
      We're excited to see pipelines run faster and boost productivity.
