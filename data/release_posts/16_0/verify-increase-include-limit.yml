    description: |
      The `include` keyword lets you compose your CI/CD configuration from multiple files. For example, you can split one
      long `.gitlab-ci.yml` file into multiple files to increase readability, or reuse one CI/CD configuration file in multiple projects.

      Previously, a single CI/CD configuration could include up to 150 files, but in GitLab 16.0 administrators can modify this limit to a different value in the instance settings.
