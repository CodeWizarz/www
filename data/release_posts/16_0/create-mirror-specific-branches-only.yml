    description: |
      Do you need to mirror a busy repository with many branches, but you only need a few of them? Limit the number of
      branches you mirror by creating a regular expression that matches only the branches you need.

      Previously, mirrors required you to mirror an entire repository, or all protected branches. This new flexibility
      can decrease the amount of data your mirrors push or pull, and keep sensitive branches out of public mirrors.
