    description: |
      When a user raises an access request for a group or project, the request appears in the To-Do List of the group or project owner.
      For groups and projects that have multiple owners, the request appears in each owner's To-Do List.

      With this new functionality, to-do items that have already been completed by another owner are marked Done in the others' To-Do Lists.
