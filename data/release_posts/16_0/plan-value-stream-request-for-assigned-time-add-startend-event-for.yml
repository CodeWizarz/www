    description: |
      Value Stream Analytics has been extended with two new stage events: issue first assigned and merge request first assigned.
      These events can be useful for measuring the time it takes for an item to be first assigned to a user.

      To implement this feature, GitLab started storing the history of assignment events in GitLab 16.0. This means that issue
      and MR assignment events prior to GitLab 16.0 are not available.
