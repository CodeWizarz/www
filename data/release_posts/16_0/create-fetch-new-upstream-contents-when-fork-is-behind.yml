      Managing your fork just got easier. When your fork is behind, select **Update fork** in the GitLab UI to catch it up with upstream changes. When your fork is ahead, select **Create merge request** to contribute your change back to the upstream project. Both operations previously required you to use the command line.

      See how many commits your fork is ahead (or behind) on your project's main page and at **Repository > Files**. If merge conflicts exist, the UI gives guidance on how to resolve them using Git from the command line.
