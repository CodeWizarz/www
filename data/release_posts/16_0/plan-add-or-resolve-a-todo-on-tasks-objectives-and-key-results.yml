    description: |
      We know that GitLab [To-Do List](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/todos.html) is a widely adopted feature, but it was not available on tasks, objectives, and key results.

      In this release, we're introducing the ability to toggle a to-do item on or off from a work item record.
