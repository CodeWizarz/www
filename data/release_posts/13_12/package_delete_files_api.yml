      description: |
        You use the GitLab Package Registry to publish, install, and share your dependencies. You may do this using a variety of package manager formats, such as Maven or npm. If you do this as part of your CI workflow, you may publish many packages to your registry. When you publish a dependency, it generates several files including the package archive.

        Prior to GitLab 13.12, GitLab didn't provide a way to delete the files from a package. You could only delete the package itself. These extra files can clutter the user interface or result in someone installing an incorrect or outdated dependency.

        In GitLab 13.12, you can now use the Packages API to delete files related to a given package, as well as the package itself. You can easily integrate this new endpoint into your CI workflow and start removing old, unused files. To give you another option for managing your registry, future releases will add the ability to [delete such files through the user interface](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/13537).
