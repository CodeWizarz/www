    description: "Project members can record time
      spent on an issue or merge request via the `/spend` quick action, but it hasn't
      been easy to understand how much time each person contributed.

      As a step toward better visibility of time reports in projects and groups,
      you can now view a time report in an individual issue or merge request.
      After time is spent against an issue, select the **Time tracking report** on the sidebar to view a list of all time spent entries for that
      issue or merge request.

      Thanks [@leetickett](https://gitlab.com/leetickett) for the contribution!"
