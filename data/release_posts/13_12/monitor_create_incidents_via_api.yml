    description: |
      The most effective incident management tools enable you to create incidents automatically from different sources. To create incidents automatically, you can integrate your proprietary systems with GitLab via API. GitLab 13.12 introduces the `issue_type` attribute to the GitLab [REST API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/issues.html#new-issue) and the `type` field to the GitLab [GraphQL API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/graphql/reference/index.html#mutationcreateissue). When creating issues with these APIs, you can create incidents by setting `issue_type` to `incident` (REST API), or by setting `type` to `INCIDENT` (GraphQL API).
