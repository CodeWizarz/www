  description: |
    Now that Praefect supports a [`per_repository` primary election strategy](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/gitaly/praefect.html#repository-specific-primary-nodes) to elect a primary for each repository,
    we will be deprecating the legacy strategies in GitLab 13.12 so we can remove them in GitLab 14.0.

    - The `local` elector is not supported in production, so should not impact production instances.
    - The `sql` elector is incompatible with the [variable replication factor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/gitaly/praefect.html#configure-replication-factor) functionality.

    For anyone using `local` or `sql` primary electors, we recommend you update to the `per_repository` election strategy as soon as possible. See the [migration documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/gitaly/praefect.html#migrate-to-repository-specific-primary-gitaly-nodes).
