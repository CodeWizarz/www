    description: |
      Creating your first GitLab CI/CD pipeline can be difficult, especially for those new to CI/CD. You might spend time switching back and forth between documentation and GitLab to get your first pipeline configured. In this release we've added a drawer with useful information to the pipeline editor to help guide you through the steps of writing your first pipeline.
