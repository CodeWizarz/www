  description: |
    With the general availability of [Gitaly Cluster](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/gitaly/#gitaly-cluster) 
    ([introduced in GitaLab 13.0](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/05/22/gitlab-13-0-released/)), we are deprecating
    support for NFS for Git repositories in GitLab 14.0.

    We want to help you avoid purchasing expensive NFS appliances
    you won't need, so invite customers currently using NFS for Git repositories to
    begin planning their migration.

    We are pleased to provide documentation on [Migrating to Gitaly Cluster](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/gitaly/praefect.html#migrate-to-gitaly-cluster).

    To see our overall status, please review our [Gitaly Cluster roadmap](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1489).
