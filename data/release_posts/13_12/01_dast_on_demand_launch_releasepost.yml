    description: |
      After months of work, we are pleased to announce that our on-demand DAST scanning has reached a General Availability (GA) maturity level. It is ready for usage by anyone who needs to scan an already-deployed application or API outside of a CI/CD pipeline job. With the 13.11 release, we added to on-demand DAST Site profiles the ability to specify authentication information, exclude URLs, add additional request headers, and switch between scanning web applications and APIs. This is in addition to the ability to save scans for quick reusability that was added in 13.9, and the ability to select the branch that a scan is associated with that was added in 13.10. We believe this feature set meets the needs of a majority of GitLab customers.

      As we continue to add features, such as scan scheduling, we expect on-demand DAST scanning to cover an ever-increasing range of use cases. As always, we would love as much feedback about these features as possible. Please let us know how things are working for you by leaving a comment in [issue 327396](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/327396).
