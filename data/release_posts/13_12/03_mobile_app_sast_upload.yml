    description: |
      Since GitLab 13.6, we've offered [SAST for Android and iOS mobile projects](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/10/22/gitlab-13-5-released/#sast-support-for-ios-and-android-mobile-apps). Initially our Mobile App SAST supported the automatic detection of Xcode projects and Android manifest files. With this release and contribution from community contributor [@proletarius101](https://gitlab.com/proletarius101), GitLab SAST now also supports the automatic detection of .ipa (iOS) and .apk (Android) binary files enabling the security scanning of fully built mobile application artifacts. This offers mobile teams more flexibility with how they build and scan their mobile projects with GitLab SAST for security vulnerabilities. 
      Please note that mobile application scanning is still an experimental feature and [requires enabling the experimental flag](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#experimental-features) in your CI template. We will make the mobile application scanner generally available without this flag [in the near future](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5977).
