    description: |
        In GitLab 14.0, we intend to make some changes to the behavior of CI/CD pipelines to improve performance and resource usage:

        - Scheduled pipeline that run very frequently can impact an instance's performance. In GitLab 14.0, we are limiting the frequency of scheduled pipelines for free users to 10 pipeline per day per project. Premium and Ultimate users will not be affected by this change.
