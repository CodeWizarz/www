    description: |
      Previously, the `rules` keyword was limited in scope and only determined if a job should be included or excluded from pipelines. [In 13.8](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2021/01/22/gitlab-13-8-released/#support-variables-for-pipeline-rules), we added the ability to use the `variables` keyword with `rules` to set variable values in a job based on which rule matched. In this release we've extended this ability to `workflow: rules`, so you can set variable values for the whole pipeline if certain conditions match. This helps you make your pipelines even more flexible.
