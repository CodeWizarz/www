      In GitLab 13.11 we [announced an experimental release](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2021/04/22/gitlab-13-11-released/#experimental-semgrep-analyzer-for-python-javascript-and-typescript) of [Semgrep](https://semgrep.dev/), a new SAST analyzer for JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python. This transition has been [developed in partnership](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2021/04/22/gitlab-13-11-released/#gitlab--semgrep-upgrading-sast-for-the-future) with [r2c](https://r2c.dev/), the team behind Semgrep who share our mission to help developers write more secure code. After an extensive beta with hundreds of customers trying out our [experimental analyzer](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#experimental-features), we're ready to start the transition to Semgrep.
      
      With 13.12, we're updating our managed `SAST.gitlab-ci.yml` CI template to automatically run this new analyzer alongside our existing JavaScript and TypeScript analyzer, ESlint. In a future release we will fully disable ESLint, but for now it will work in unison with Semgrep. We've done work to deduplicate findings, so you should not notice any difference in findings. If you include our `SAST.gitlab-ci.yml`, you don't need to do anything to start benefiting from the Semgrep analyzer, however if you override or manage your own SAST CI configuration, [you should update your CI configuration](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml#L275). 

      Both GitLab and r2c are excited about the future of this transition to bring you fast and wide coverage Static Application Security Testing (SAST). We'll continue to expand the Semgrep analyzer through new security detection rules as well as expanding coverage to other languages. We've created a [feedback issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/330578) where you can share your experience with this transition or ask questions.
