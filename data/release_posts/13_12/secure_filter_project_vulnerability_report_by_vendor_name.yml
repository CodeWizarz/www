    description: |
      GitLab strives to play well with others and security is no exception. We provide many security scanners as part of our Secure offering. We also encourage 3rd party vendors to [integrate their scanning tools](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/integrations/secure.html) using our open API and data interchange formats. A benefit of using GitLab is managing vulnerabilities from multiple scanners in a unified experience. While you were already able to filter by scanner type (SAST, DAST), it wasn't possible to drill down by the tool provider.

      You now have even more granularity when managing vulnerabilities with the new ability to filter by scanner and vendor. You can look at all results across a single vendor's scanners or gain confidence in findings from one scan type (e.g. SAST) that are confirmed by both GitLab and the 3rd party tool. The new filtering capability is available now in Project Vulnerability Reports.
