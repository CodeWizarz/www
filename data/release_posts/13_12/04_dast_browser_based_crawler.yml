    description: |
      Starting in 13.12, we are extremely excited to announce the beta release of our new browser-based crawler. Since we are in the beta phase, we are actively seeking DAST users who will enable the new crawler and give us feedback. This new crawler is specifically designed to provide better application testing coverage by finding more pages on a JavaScript-heavy app that might be hidden from a traditional proxy-based crawler. As websites and applications continue to be more and more JavaScript-heavy, we have seen the need for a new generation of tools that are purpose-built to address the needs of JavaScript-heavy and single-page applications. This is our first step in the journey to provide better crawl and test coverage for these modern applications.

      In our benchmark testing, our browser-based crawler has shown a significant improvement in crawl coverage from our current proxy-based crawler. We want feedback from usage on real-world applications to validate that the new crawler is able to crawl a majority of pages for a majority of apps. The process for enabling this new crawler is documented at [DAST browser-based crawler](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dast/browser_based.html#enable-browser-based-crawling).

      Any and all feedback is welcomed and encouraged, as are bug reports. Feel free to comment [in issue 327394](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/327394) or create a new issue and assign it to `@derekferguson`. We look forward to bringing this feature to GA in the next few months and providing better DAST coverage for modern applications.
