    description: |
      Since GitLab 13.2, you've been able to use the `release:` keyword, in conjunction with the [release-cli](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release-cli/-/tree/master/docs), to create a release.
      The `release:` keyword has now been extended to include support for asset links so that you can create releases and attach files to them in a single `.gitlab-ci.yml` release job.
