    description: |
      GitLab makes it easy for teams to set up end-to-end testing with automation tools like Selenium that capture screenshots of failed tests as artifacts. This is great until you have to sort through a huge archive of screenshots looking for the specific one you need to debug a failing test. Eventually, you may give up due to frustration and just re-run the test locally to try and figure out the source of the issue instead of wasting more time.

      Now, you can link directly to the captured screenshot from the details screen in the Unit Test report on the pipeline page. This lets you quickly review the captured screenshot alongside the stack trace to identify what failed as fast as possible.
