        You can use the GitLab Package Registry to publish and download your project's generic packages. By default, you can publish the same package name and version multiple times.

        However, many of you have expressed that you want to prevent duplicate uploads, especially for releases. GitLab 13.12 expands the group setting for the Package Registry to allow or prevent duplicate uploads.

        You can adjust this setting by using the [GitLab API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/graphql/reference/index.html#packagesettings), or from **Settings > Packages & Registries** in the application. The coming milestones will continue to expand this setting for each package manager format. Please follow along in the [epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5070) or consider contributing a change!
