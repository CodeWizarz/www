        The `includes:` keyword for CI/CD pipelines lets you break one long `.gitlab-ci.yml` file into multiple smaller files to increase readability. It also makes it easier to reuse configuration in multiple places. Frequently there are multiple files included into a single pipeline, and they all might be stored in the same place. In this release, we add support to use the `*` wildcard with the local `includes:` keyword. You can now make your `includes:` sections more dynamic, less verbose, and easier to read, check out how we are [dogfooding](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/commit/f0629cc5eaa70a29cb2d98e5e1e0915d4968840e) it in GitLab.
