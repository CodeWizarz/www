    Lee did an excellent job iterating on our existing
    [time tracking](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/time_tracking.html)
    functionality by adding a
    [time tracking report](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/60161) feature!
    This allows you to easily see who has spent time on an issue, and even allows you to add notes!

    This contribution is a significant step forward as it not only allows you to view who has
    spent how much time on an issue, but also allows you to see the total time spent by all
    contributors. There is even an option to add notes when you log time and view them
    within the report.

    Lee has also contributed two additional
    merge requests to improve the GraphQL API, one to
    [expose merge request timelogs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/57322),
    and one expand the GraphQL query to
    [find merge requests](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/60190).
 
    Thank you for all of your amazing work Lee! ðŸ™Œ
