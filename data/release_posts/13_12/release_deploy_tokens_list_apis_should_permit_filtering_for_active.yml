    description: |
      Before this milestone, the [Deploy Tokens API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/deploy_tokens.html) endpoints for listing tokens would return all database stored entries, including revoked and expired tokens, without a way to filter the list. Now we have added the ability to filter only active tokens from the REST API. A huge thanks to [Devin Christensen](https://gitlab.com/quixoten) for a great community contribution!
