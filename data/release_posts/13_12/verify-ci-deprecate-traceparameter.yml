deprecations:
- feature_name: "Removal of deprecated 'trace' parameter from 'jobs' API endpoint"
  due: June 22, 2021
  reporter: jreporter
  description: |
   GitLab Runner was updated in GitLab 13.4 to internally stop passing the `trace` parameter to the `/api/jobs/:id` endpoint. In GitLab 14.0 we will deprecate the `trace` parameter entirely for all other requests of this endpoint. Make sure your [GitLab Runner version matches your GitLab version](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/#gitlab-runner-versions) to ensure consistent behavior.
