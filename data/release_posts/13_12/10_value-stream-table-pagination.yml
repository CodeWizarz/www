      description: |
        Previously, Value Stream Analytics only displayed the 20 newest workflow items for each stage in a value stream. This update adds pagination and sorting for workflow items. 

        You can now view all the items in each stage of your value stream and sort by time spent in a stage to more easily pinpoint bottlenecks in the software development lifecycle. For example, if code changes have been taking longer to merge, sort items in the Code stage to identify the slowest items and investigate possible causes.
