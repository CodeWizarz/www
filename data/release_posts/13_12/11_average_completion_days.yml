      description: |
        The Days to Completion chart in Value Stream Analytics previously showed the sum of days it took to complete all workflow items that were finished on a specific day. If an unusually high number of items was completed on the same day, the chart would show a high number for that day, which isn't particularly meaningful.

        The chart now shows the average time to completion instead, which highlights meaningful trends over time.
