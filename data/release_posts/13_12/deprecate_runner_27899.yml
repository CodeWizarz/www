    description: |
      Microsoft's end of support date for Windows Server version 1909 end was 2021-05-11. In keeping with our support policy for Windows Server, we will remove Windows 1909 support from GitLab Runner. If you are still using Windows Server 1909, then docker-windows on GitLab Runner 14.0+ will no longer work. Refer to issue [#27899](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/issues/27899) for details.
