      description: |
        Static site generators consume the first few lines ("front matter") at the beginning of a Markdown file, between two `---` lines, to format, configure, or parse the page. Front matter isn't meant to be displayed alongside the content of the page, and must conform to specific formatting rules.

        GitLab's Static Site Editor now includes a rich content editing experience that parses the Markdown syntax and displays it in a more familiar style. However, the front matter, not being intended for display, gets rendered unexpectedly in this context, and editing it using the visual editor can have unintended consequences.

        GitLab 13.1 hides any YAML-formatted front matter included at the beginning of the Markdown file to prevent any confusion or unintended formatting changes. The front matter remains editable in the raw source editor, available by toggling the editor mode in the bottom right of the Static Site Editor.
