        Originally introduced in GitLab 11.4 as a GitLab Premium feature,
        Merge Request Reviews
        allow merge request reviewers to submit multiple comments at once, cutting down on notification noise
        for the merge request author, and allowing for a more cohesive and streamlined review process.

        Since its introduction, we've re-evaluated its place in our
        [buyer-based pricing model](https://about.gitlab.com/company/pricing/#four-tiers)
        and as part of 13.1 we're excited to announce this feature has now moved to GitLab Core.
