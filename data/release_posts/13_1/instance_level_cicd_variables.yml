        GitLab now supports instance-level variables. With this ability to set global variables, you no longer need to manually enter the same credentials repeatedly for all your projects. This MVC introduces access to this feature by API, and the next iteration of this feature will provide the ability to configure instance-level variables directly in the UI.
