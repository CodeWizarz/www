      description: |
        All too often, a project has a code coverage target but development teams might not have much visibility into which direction that target value is trending over time. There needs to be an easier way to track changes in code coverage over time without that extra hassle. 

        The Code Coverage graph now provides better visibility into how code coverage is trending over time. It displays a simple graph of the coverage value(s) calculated in pipelines. We are looking forward to [feedback from customers](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/219659) on this feature as we plan improvements and future iterations.
