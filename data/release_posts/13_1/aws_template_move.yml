deprecations:
  - feature_name: "Deployment template for AWS ECS is moving to a new location"
    due: Jul 22, 2020
    reporter: ogolowinski
    description: |
      We are changing the location of the Deploy to AWS ECS `gitlab-ci.yml` template. If you have referenced this template in your CI/CD configuration, please update it by replacing `template: Deploy-ECS.gitlab-ci.yml` with `template: AWS/Deploy-ECS.gitlab-ci.yml`. We are expanding our supported AWS targets, and all future AWS-related templates will be found in the AWS template folder.
