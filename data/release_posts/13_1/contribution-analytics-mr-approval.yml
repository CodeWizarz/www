      description: |
        Contribution Analytics helps teams understand how workload is balanced across many participants. Until now, the contributions of merge request approvers were overlooked, despite their valuable role in ensuring merge requests receive an appropriate level of review. The table of contributions per group member now includes a sortable **Approved MRs** column to display approvers by the number of approvals completed.
