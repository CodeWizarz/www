    description: |
      To increase the security and reduce complexity of scans, use of Docker-in-Docker (DinD) in GitLab Secure scanners was [deprecated in 13.0](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/05/22/gitlab-13-0-released/#deprecation-of-docker-in-docker-(dind)-for-security-scanners) and is **scheduled for removal in 13.4**. GitLab security products started to use non-DinD mode by default in vendored templates in GitLab 13.0. We encourage customers to update their vendored templates to use this new behavior. If you override or use custom [Secure CI templates](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/tree/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security), you can follow the guides below to disable Docker in Docker (DinD) from your existing job templates:
