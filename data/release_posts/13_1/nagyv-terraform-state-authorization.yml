      description: |
        Changing your infrastructure is always a high-risk action; it should always be supervised, audited, and restricted to team members with permission. We introduced the GitLab-managed Terraform state with a known limitation in GitLab 13.0: you were required to provide a personal access token to work with the state file. This option did not scale well.

        Starting with GitLab 13.1, we've extended the scope of [the auto-generated CI token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/predefined_variables.html) with the acting user's credentials. The token is designed specifically to run Terraform state management jobs, enabling you to securely run Terraform job pipelines without any additional setup.
