    description: |  
      To help maintain the overall performance for everyone using gitlab.com, the [expiration for pipeline artifacts](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/gitlab_com/index.html#gitlab-cicd) will be set to 30 days on gitlab.com. The artifacts from the [last successful job](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/16267) will not be archived until 30 days after a newer job generates new artifacts. Artifacts without expiration dates will not be changed, but a future update will add an expiration date to them as well.
