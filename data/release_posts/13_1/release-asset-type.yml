      description: |
        GitLab now lets you conveniently specify the kind of asset link you have added to your Release with a dropdown menu. Previously, if you added links to a release, you were unable to communicate what type of asset it was. With this addition, you can choose the type of asset from the following options: "Runbook", "Package", "Image", or "Other."
