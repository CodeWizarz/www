    description: |
      For integrating Kubernetes with GitLab, we've introduced a [Kubernetes support policy](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/clusters/#supported-cluster-versions) to provide GitLab users with clear upgrade timelines. Two deprecations are scheduled:

      - GitLab's support for Kubernetes 1.12 ends on September 22, 2020.
      - GitLab's support for Kubernetes 1.13 ends on November 22, 2020.

      Various GitLab features may still work following these deprecations, but are not officially supported. GitLab is simultaneously working on adding support for more recent Kubernetes versions.
