    description: |
      Feature Flag created before 13.1 are not compatible with the new architecture that we are developing. From 13.1, all new feature flags created on GitLab.com will be created with the new system by default. From 13.2, the same will be true for self-managed instances. Feature flags created in earlier versions can be edited until 13.4, and then they will become read-only. In 14.0, all legacy feature flags will be completely removed.
