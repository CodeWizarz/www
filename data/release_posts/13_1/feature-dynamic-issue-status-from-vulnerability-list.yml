      description: |
       Previously, in Security Dashboards, vulnerability list items with an 
       associated issue displayed a static icon with a link to the issue. With 
       this usability improvement, the icon now dynamically reflects whether the 
       issue is open or closed. At a glance, you can now tell if a vulnerability 
       might need additional attention.
