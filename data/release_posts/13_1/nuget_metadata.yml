        When a NuGet package is uploaded to GitLab, a job opens the archive and reads the `.nuspec` file. The package name and version are extracted, but several other fields, like `dependencies`, `project_url` and `tags` are available but not extracted. These fields are useful for understanding how a package has been built and what its dependencies are.

        In GitLab 13.1, we are excited to announce that this metadata will now be extracted as part of the upload and included in the user interface so that you validate that package was built properly.
