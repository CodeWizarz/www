      When deploying GitLab in Kubernetes, the [minimum supported version](https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/installation/#requirements) of Kubernetes is now 1.13. Kubernetes 1.12 is [no longer maintained upstream](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/version-skew-policy/#supported-versions), and has recently been dropped by popular container management services such as GKE and EKS.
