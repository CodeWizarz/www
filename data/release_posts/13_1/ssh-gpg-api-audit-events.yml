        Thank you to [Rajendra Kadam (@raju249)](https://gitlab.com/raju249) for this community contribution!

        When an SSH key is created for a user via the API, either by the [user](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/34645) or an [administrator](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/33859), you will now see this action logged in the audit events table. Previously, these actions were not logged and created a gap in the auditability of SSH credentials for a user.
