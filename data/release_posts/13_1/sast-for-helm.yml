      description: |
        Our [Static Application Security Scanning (SAST) analyzer](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/) for [Kubernetes manifests](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#supported-languages-and-frameworks) has been updated to support Helm Charts. This update also [adds support for two new environment variables](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#analyzer-settings) to customize our analyzer settings: `KUBESEC_HELM_CHARTS_PATH` and `KUBESEC_HELM_OPTIONS`.

        A special thanks to [@agixid](https://gitlab.com/agixid) for their community contribution to this feature.
