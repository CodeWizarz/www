      description: |
        Now that you're able to create requirements in GitLab, the next step towards a full requirements management solution is showing your requirements are satisfied.

        We're excited to release the first step by allowing you to configure jobs within the standard CI pipeline that, when triggered, will mark all existing requirements as satisfied. This CI job can be either manual or automatic, and like other CI jobs can be configured to allow failure so it doesn't block the pipeline from completing. Future iterations will allow [selectively satisfying requirements from pipeline testing](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/215514) as well as allowing our customers performing manual verification to [indicate satisfied requirements through the interface](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/218607).
