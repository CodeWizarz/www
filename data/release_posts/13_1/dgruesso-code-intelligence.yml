      description: |
        Code review is an important process that requires an understanding of the proposed change
        and surrounding code to know if it has been made in a maintainable way. Easily browsing definitions while writing new code
        or reviewing changes to existing code allows developers to gain a better understanding
        of the software being written. This is extremely useful when reviewing new code as well as code
        changes in merge requests. However, setting up browsable definitions generally meant configuring
        external tools and resources, or using a dedicated IDE. With GitLab, this is no longer the case.

        Taking inspiration in the great work done by our partners at [Sourcegraph](https://about.sourcegraph.com/)
        and powered by the [LSIF format](https://lsif.dev/),
        GitLab's native Code Intelligence can be added to any project by adding a
        new job to the project's `.gitlab-ci.yml` file, which specifies an LSIF report.
        Once generated, hovering over objects in your code will present the available
        code intelligence actions. No external tools or IDEs required.

        Future iterations will include the ability to find references, as well as API support. You can
        follow along in the [Code Intelligence epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1576).
