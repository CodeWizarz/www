        You can now filter by pipeline status or by tag name on the pipelines page. With filtering, viewing all pipelines for a specific tag, or narrowing the list of pipelines to a specific pipeline status (such as failed or skipped) is much easier. With these additions to the existing filter options, pinpointing your desired pipeline is easier than ever, and saves time in your day.
