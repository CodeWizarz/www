        From the Group Security Dashboard, you can now download a CSV file containing 
        detected vulnerabilities for all projects in a group. This export list can 
        then be used for things such as creating compliance reports or as a data 
        source for external dashboards. This joins the ability to export
        reports from the [Instance](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/security_dashboard/#export-vulnerabilities-1) 
        and [Project Security Dashboards](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/security_dashboard/#export-vulnerabilities).

        Simply go to any Group Security Dashboard and click the new 'Export'
        button. Your browser will automatically start the download.
