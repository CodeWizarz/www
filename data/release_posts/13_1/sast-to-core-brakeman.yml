      description: |
        We want to help developers write better code and worry less about common security mistakes. [Static Application Security Testing (SAST)](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/) helps prevent security vulnerabilities by allowing developers to easily identify common security issues as code is being contributed, and mitigate them proactively. As part of our [community stewardship commitment](/company/stewardship/#promises), we are making our Rails [SAST analyzer](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#supported-languages-and-frameworks) (Brakeman) available in every [GitLab tier](/pricing/). This will allow **ALL** GitLab users developing in Rails to leverage [SAST Security Scans](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/) for their projects.
        We will continue to move other open source (OSS) SAST analyzers to Core. You can follow our [SAST to Core epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2098) to see when other analyzers will become available, and contribute to this effort.
