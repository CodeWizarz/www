      description: |
        One of the most important aspects of compliance is knowing who can access your business systems and resources. You need to know what role or permissions they possess so you can audit that access against your policies. Generating this type of evidence should be easy, so we've added a new API to provide group and project memberships for a user. You can now programmatically list all of the groups and projects a user belongs to along with their respective role for each resource. You no longer need to search through groups, projects, and logs to aggregate this data.
