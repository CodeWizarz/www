      description: |
        Metric panels are most useful when they facilitate drill-down. In GitLab 13.1, you can add custom URLs to the **More actions** menu for panels in your metrics dashboard, cross-linking your metrics panel and dashboard with other metrics dashboards and additional troubleshooting tools your team uses.
