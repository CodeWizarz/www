    description: |
      Gitaly Cluster improves fault tolerance of Git storage in GitLab by removing single points of failure, detecting
      outages, and automatically switching to a replica. From GitLab 13.1, when Gitaly Cluster is configured, SQL leader
      election and automatic failover are enabled by default.

      If unreplicated write operations are detected during failover, the cluster is put into read only mode to prevent
      a [split brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-brain_(computing)). In the future,
      [strong consistency](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1189) will require that write operations succeed
      on multiple Gitaly nodes before responding with a success signal, preventing this problem and the need to mark the
      cluster read only.

      Previously in GitLab 13.0, in memory leader election was default instead of automatic failover.
