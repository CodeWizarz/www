    description: |
      GitLab is moving Auto DevOps from Herokuish buildpacks to Cloud Native Buildpacks, as [Herokuish is essentially deprecated](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/25954#note_220760807) and Cloud Native Buildpacks are the next iteration of buildpack support. GitLab versions 12.10 and greater [support Cloud Native Buildpacks](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/autodevops/stages.html#auto-build-using-cloud-native-buildpacks-beta). All new Auto DevOps projects will begin using Cloud Native Buildpacks in the next month, and Herokuish support will be dropped in October 2020.
