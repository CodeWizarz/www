      description: |
        GitLab 13.0 introduced [standalone vulnerability pages](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/vulnerabilities/) as an important
        step towards the future of Vulnerability Management. The switch from popup
        information boxes to independent pages, however, presented some new UI
        considerations.

        Navigating from the Security Dashboards to a vulnerability page and back
        previously cleared any filters applied on the dashboard. We received
        good feedback that improving this experience would improve the vulnerability
        triage and management experience. Your filters now
        persist when moving between vulnerability pages and a dashboard,
        greatly improving the efficiency of managing vulnerabilities. It also matches
        a familiar UX pattern found elsewhere in GitLab, such as managing your To-Do
        list.
