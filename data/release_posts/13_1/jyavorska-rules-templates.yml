        It can be hard to figure out how to use the new `rules` keyword, especially if you previously used `only/except`, as the two are fundamentally different. The `rules` keyword creates a merge request pipeline by default, and `only/except` doesn't.

        To ease getting started, and getting to your first green pipeline with `rules` more quickly, we've added the two most common `workflow: rules` configurations as bundled templates. These make it much easier to get things working right away, letting you focus on what's important.
