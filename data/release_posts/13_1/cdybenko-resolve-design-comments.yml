        When you receive lots of feedback on a Design, the number of comment pins can build up quickly! As your discussion thread grows, it gets hard to know which discussions are complete and which still need work.

        With 13.1, you’ll have the ability to mark any comment as **Resolved** to signify that it is now complete. Even better — your resolved comment pins will disappear from the Design so you can focus on what’s left! And, of course, if you need to revisit something, all of your resolved threads will be available in the **Resolved Comment** area at the bottom of the sidebar. From there, you can find them again and see which revision applied at the point of revision.

        We think this will greatly improve your workflow so you can focus on what is important.
