      description: |
        Developers collaborating on projects follow certain coding standards and styles to maintain consistent levels of readability and formatting in the project. This configuration is often done through an [`.editorconfig`](https://editorconfig.org/) file inside of the project which provides instructions like indent style, indent size, and line endings.

        When opening a file, the Web IDE looks for a file named `.editorconfig` in the current directory and all parent directories. If a config file is found and has settings that match the file's path, the settings will be enforced on the opened file. The Web IDE provides support for most of the [widely supported features](https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig/wiki/EditorConfig-Properties#widely-supported-by-editors) of EditorConfig with an exception for [`charset`](https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig/wiki/EditorConfig-Properties#charset).
