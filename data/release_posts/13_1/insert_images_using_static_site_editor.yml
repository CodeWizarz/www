      description: |
        The Static Site Editor offers immediate visual feedback when writing Markdown content, and intuitive formatting controls to ensure consistent and accurate markup. However, this visual editing experience introduced in GitLab 13.0 was limited to text content.

        In GitLab 13.1, you can quickly add images to your pages using the Static Site Editor. After clicking the Image icon in the formatting bar, just link to a URL, add optional [ALT text](https://moz.com/learn/seo/alt-text), and you're done. The link can reference images already hosted in your project, an asset hosted externally on a content delivery network, or any other external URL. The editor renders thumbnail previews so you can verify the correct image is included and there aren't any references to missing images.
