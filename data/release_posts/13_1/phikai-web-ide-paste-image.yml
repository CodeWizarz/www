        When working with Markdown content in the Web IDE, you may need to add images to the content. Adding images in most editors requires finding that image, adding it to the directory structure and then referencing it through markdown syntax.

        The Web IDE now supports pasting images directly into the editing window. Copy an image to your clipboard, place your cursor in your the Web IDE where you'd like the image to appear, and paste. The image will automatically be uploaded to your project and appropriately referenced inside of your content, greatly speeding up the content creation process and reducing complexity for users.
