        Issue titles will now always remain visible at the top of the issue, regardless of what part of the issue you're reading. This ensures that you'll always have context, regardless of whether you've clicked a link to a deep conversation thread, scrolled deep within an issue, or you're working with multiple tabs of similar issues.
