      description: |
        This feature expands on the API capability of [setting a deploy freeze window](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/freeze_periods.html), which we introduced in 13.0. Now, from the GitLab UI, you can easily set a time period when deployments can't occur. You no longer have to use the API to script your deploy freeze or use `.gitlab-ci.yml`. Instead, you can easily go to the UI settings to create a recurring or one-time deploy freeze.
