        The GitLab Package Registry is where you store and share a variety of package formats. When you navigate to the user interface, you want to quickly understand how the package was built and how to install it. We've redesigned the package details page to prioritize recent activity, code snippets, and additional metadata. We removed the two-column table that had data that was duplicated or not useful.

        The main section of the package detail UI now includes:

        - A new "History" feed that shares the time-based metadata related to a package.
        - The installation commands and registry setup instructions.
        - A way to add "Additional Metadata" to capture any metadata not related to time. This additional metadata section offers the flexibility of including a variety of details specific to different package formats.

        This change is a clear sign that the Package Registry capabilities with GitLab are maturing. The 'ugly' table that we removed was a carry-over from the original Maven Repository. Back then, we only presented basic metadata like `name` and `created_date`. Now you can see how a package was built and trace back to which pipeline and which commit was responsible. We look forward to the continued evolution of this product. Enjoy and let us know what you think!
