        A year and a half ago, we expanded our support for Java projects and developers by building Maven support directly into GitLab. Our goal was to provide a standardized way to share packages and have version control across projects. Since then, we've invested to build out the Package team further while working with our customers and community to better understand your use cases. We also added support for Node, C#/.NET, C/C++, Python, PHP, and Go developers. Your increased adoption, usage, and contributions to these features have allowed us to expand our vision to a more comprehensive solution, integrated into our single application, which supports package management for all commonly-used languages and binary formats. This goal could not have been achieved without the explicit support of the GitLab community. 

        As part of GitLab's stewardship promises, we are excited to announce that the basic functionality for each package manager format is now available in the GitLab Core Edition. This means that if you use npm, Maven, NuGet, Conan, PyPI, Composer or Go modules, you will be able to: 

        - Use GitLab as a private (or public) package registry
        - Authenticate using your GitLab credentials, personal access, or job token
        - Publish packages to GitLab
        - Install packages from GitLab
        - Search for packages hosted on GitLab
        - Access an easy-to-use UI that displays package details and metadata and allows you to download any relevant files
        - Ensure that your contributions are available for ALL GitLab users

        We look forward to hearing your feedback and continuing to improve these features with all of our users.
