      description: |
         Seeing all of your system's metrics in one place, including cluster metrics, is critical for understanding the health of your system. In GitLab 13.3, you can view the health of your Kubernetes pods in the new out-of-the-box Pod health metrics dashboard, whether you are using a [managed Prometheus](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/prometheus.html#managed-prometheus-on-kubernetes), or have an existing instance of Prometheus running in your cluster, by connecting it to your GitLab instance. Select the desired pod in the dropdown and see key metrics such as CPU, memory usage, Network, and more.
