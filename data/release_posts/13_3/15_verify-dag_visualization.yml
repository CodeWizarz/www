      description: |
        You may have noticed the new DAG tab on your pipelines that visually renders the [directed acyclic graph](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/directed_acyclic_graph/index.html) dependencies for pipelines using the `needs` keyword. This makes it easier to understand complex webs of dependencies in your CI/CD configuration. In this release, we consider the feature officially released and are removing the beta tag! Your feedback is still welcome, as always, so let us know what you think.
