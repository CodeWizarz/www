        Static site generators often rely on Markdown to organize content and the Static Site Editor offers an intuitive WYSIWYG Markdown editing experience for those documents. However, their content isn't always written in Markdown. Many generators support additional markup embedded in the Markdown to extend the author's capabilities. It is also valid to write HTML alongside markdown content.

        The Static Side Editor's WYSIWYG mode now separates non-Markdown content into uneditable content blocks, displayed inline with your content. This prevents unexpected formatting errors that can arise when the editor attempts to convert non-Markdown content to HTML. The non-Markdown content is still editable in the raw source mode of the Static Site Editor and future iterations will enable safely editing this kind of content within the WYSIWYG mode.
