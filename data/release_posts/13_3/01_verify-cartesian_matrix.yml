        GitLab's [child/parent pipelines](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/16094) let you write your own code to generate an entire pipeline YAML. This is a powerful way to generate custom behaviors, including generating jobs at runtime. This might not be needed for simpler scenarios where you just want to create multiple similar jobs for a defined set of cases. In this release you can find a new `matrix` keyword that works along with `parallel` to handle the creation of multiple jobs for you, each with different variables.

        For example, you could configure your pipeline to automatically create jobs for 4 different architectures, each with a `debug` and `release` target for 3 different versions, all with a single matrix-style configuration. This would create 24 unique jobs (4x2x3) to cover every possible combination.
