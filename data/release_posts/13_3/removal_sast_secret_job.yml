      Since [GitLab 13.1](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/06/22/gitlab-13-1-released/#deprecation-of-secret-detection-job-in-sast-configuration), the [Secret Detection](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/secret_detection/) CI/CD configuration settings are now provided in a separate GitLab-provided template and run as a new Secure scan type. This new Secret Detection template is also now [included in Auto DevOps](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/#security-scanning-with-auto-devops) for easy setup. 

      In 13.4 we will remove the [old SAST `secrets-sast` job definition](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/67e235bd5826c160db47bbb8c0dc87e6b9cd7b43/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml#L171) and if you have not switched to the [new Secret Detection template](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/secret_detection/#configuration) you will not continue to scan for secrets. You can easily transition by adding the new template.

      Before upgrading to GitLab 13.4 we recommend you [add the new Secret Detection template](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/secret_detection/#configuration) to your `gitlab-ci.yml` file, and then remove the [old SAST `secrets-sast` job definition](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/67e235bd5826c160db47bbb8c0dc87e6b9cd7b43/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml#L171) from the [SAST configuration template](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#configuration) in `SAST.gitlab-ci.yml` file. We have made a [video to guide you through the process of transitioning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2tjcQreDwQ&feature=emb_title) to this new template. 

      You can follow [the removal issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/234011) for further details.
