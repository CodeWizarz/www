      description: |
        We've upgraded the web editor to a lighter-weight version of the editor found in our Web IDE. This adds basic code completion and linting for some languages. We've also improved source code language detection for better syntax highlighting, and added support for all our [syntax highlighting themes](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/preferences.html#syntax-highlighting-theme). These improvements make it easier to edit and collaborate on files in projects.
