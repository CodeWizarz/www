    description: |-
      When coordinating response teams across multiple incidents, it's extremely important to know which Incidents are open - and require immediate attention - and which ones are resolved and closed. GitLab 13.3 now separates Incidents by status and organizes them into tabs, helping you to focus on the relevant, open Incidents.
