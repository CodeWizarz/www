    description: |-
      When an incident occurs, knowing how to respond can be difficult if the on-call engineers didn't write the code causing an incident. Having access to runbooks, or knowledge about a metric causing alerts, is critical to identifying the root cause of a problem and solving it quickly. You can now add runbooks to the alerts you configure in GitLab so that triggered alerts provide your on-call team the steps needed to resolve the issue.
