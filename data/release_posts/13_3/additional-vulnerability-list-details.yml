      description: |
        The Project Security Dashboard is getting even more useful with the addition
        of new data fields to the vulnerability list. Putting more details on the
        main dashboard provides an even better overview of a project's vulnerabilities
        without having to open the individual vulnerability pages.

        For scanners that run against source code, you can now see the line number
        in the vulnerable file. We're also including the scanner type (SAST, DAST,
        etc.) which you can filter by. This makes it easy to quickly drill into a 
        specific subset of vulnerabilities.


        We've also improved the display of vulnerability identifiers. Many scanners
        can include more than one identifier for a given vulnerability such as a CVE,
        CWE, or a proprietary ID. Previously, we picked the first identifier provided
        to display on the vulnerability list. Now, we always show the CVE if one is
        available. We also indicate the total number of other identifiers.
