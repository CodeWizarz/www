      description: |
        We have improved the logic for unknown sign-in email notifications so that users receive fewer emails. We recommend leaving unknown sign-in email notifications enabled, but GitLab administrators will now also have the option to disable unknown sign-in email notifications for their instance. This option can be used in cases where users cannot accept cookies in their browser and users' IPs change often.
