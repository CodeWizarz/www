    description: |
      Repositories with many contributors combined with highly parallelized CI pipelines, or highly variable project access patterns can cause high CPU and memory usage, decreasing availability. Mitigating these performance problems by sharding generally results in over-provisioning to handle peak load.

      Gitaly Cluster allows Git repositories to be replicated on multiple warm Gitaly nodes, and can be used to scale performance by distributing read operations between up-to-date replicas. From GitLab 13.3, when using Gitaly Cluster, read operations will automatically be distributed between up-to-date replicas. This better utilizes the available CPU and memory resources, and scales better in comparison to sharding. Read the [Cluster or Shard](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/gitaly/praefect.html#cluster-or-shard) documentation to learn more about the benefits of Gitaly Cluster.

      **Note:** Gitaly Clusters can be created using GitLab Core and higher tiers. However, technical support is limited to GitLab Premium and Ultimate customers only.
