      description: |
        Code review is an important process that requires an understanding of the proposed change and surrounding code to know if it has been made in a maintainable way. GitLab's native Code Intelligence helps developers navigate code and understand changes introduced in merge requests. This is important to understand existing code as well to ensure new code is added in a responsible way.

        GitLab 13.3 introduces the ability to display references for projects using GitLab's native Code Intelligence. Clicking on an object in your code will display the definition and offer the ability to browse references on the second tab, displaying the full path and line number where the object is being used.

        Future iterations will include API support and displaying the code for references in the popover. You can follow along in the [Code Intelligence epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1576).
