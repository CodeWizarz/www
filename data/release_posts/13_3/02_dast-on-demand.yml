        Dynamic Application Security Testing at GitLab has always been focused on integrating DAST into the DevOps pipeline and enabling developers to scan their review app, running website, or API for vulnerabilities as early as possible. However, there are times when it is necessary to run a DAST scan against an already deployed application when no code changes have been made and no Merge Request has been created. These scans could be needed for audit or compliance reasons, to debug and reproduce an issue that has been found, or to support teams who do not commit code, such as security analysts. Because of the need for DAST scans that are not triggered by a code change or MR, on-demand DAST testing is now available.
        You don't need configuration files or code to start running on-demand scans. Configuration options for on-demand DAST scans are available within the GitLab UI. The result is quicker configuration and greatly improved ease of use. When starting a new on-demand scan you select from a site profile that contains your preferred settings.
        In 13.3, we are releasing the first iteration of the on-demand scans. These scans will initially be limited to a 60-second spider time and a passive DAST scan. This scan will give a quick reconnaissance-type overview of the site you are scanning, without causing any performance or security issues.  Over the next few releases, we will be adding options to the Site profile and introducing the Scanner profile. These additions will allow you to increase the spider time, validate ownership of the target site, enable active scans, set authentication options, and more.
