      description: |
        Commenting on a specific line in a merge request diff is a great way to leave feedback for the author.
        Reviewers often need to comment on an entire section of the code, for example a function or expression which covers multiple lines of code.
        Leaving a comment on a single line, while referring to many lines, makes communication less clear and less efficient.

        With the introduction of multi-line comments, reviewers will no longer need to decide which single line
        of code to choose during a review, instead they will be able to provide feedback to multiple lines in
        the merge request diff.
        
        Future iterations will include multi-line suggestions as well as increased ease of use. You can follow along
        in the [multi-line comments epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1431).
