        **If** you use the `rules` keyword with `if` clauses, it's now even more powerful, with support for bracketed expressions evaluated by the pipeline processor. You can use more complex and efficient AND (`&&`) / OR (`||`) expressions, making your pipelines rules more logical, powerful, and easier to manage.
