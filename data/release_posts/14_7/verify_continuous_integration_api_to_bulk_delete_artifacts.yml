    description: |
      While a good strategy for managing storage consumption is to set regular expiration policies for artifacts, sometimes you need to reduce items in storage right away. Previously, you might have used a script to automate the tedious task of deleting artifacts one by one with API calls, but now you can use a new API endpoint to bulk delete job artifacts quickly and easily.
