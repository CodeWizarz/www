      description: |
        For some GitLab customers, U.S. government regulatory requirements require the use of FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standards) compliant software. The FIPS 140-2 and FIPS 140-3 publications define the security requirements for cryptographic modules used in computer and telecommunication systems, and within cyber systems that protect sensitive information. GitLab Runner is now FIPS 140-2 compliant for AMD64 compute architectures and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) distributions. Refer to [this epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5104) to follow the discussions about making GitLab FIPS compliant.
