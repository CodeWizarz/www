    description: |
      In previous releases, we added personalization questions to the group creation process. This information might be helpful for our SaaS users on GitLab.com, but less helpful for self-managed instances. We found out that these additional questions confuse the users and complicate the group creation process. In this release, thanks to [Jonas WÃ¤lter's](https://gitlab.com/wwwjon) contribution, we've added the ability for GitLab administrators  to disable these questions.
