    Fabio added support for group access tokens, including a [UI](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/77449) and a [REST API](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/77236). The enormity of this contribution shows the breadth of effort this contribution spanned in: [one epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3055), three issues, and over 250 community upvotes for this feature!

    Previously, access tokens were only available at the project level. There was a workaround that allowed self-managed admins to generate a group access token via the rails console, but that left our SaaS customers in the dark.

    Fabio's contribution allows any user with the proper privileges to [generate access tokens](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/settings/group_access_tokens.html) at the group level. These tokens can be generated with a pre-defined [role](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html), expiration date, and scope.

    Thank you, Fabio, for your incredible contribution! ðŸ™Œ
