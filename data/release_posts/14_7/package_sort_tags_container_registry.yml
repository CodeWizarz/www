    description: |
      You can now sort the list of tags in the Container Registry tag details page by name. Previously, there was no sort functionality. This sometimes required you to scroll through many pages to find a specific tag. By default, the tags list is now sorted by name in ascending order. You may also change the sort order to descending. See [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/346362) to track any further work on tag sorting.
