        GitLab Static Analysis is comprised of a [set of many security analyzers](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#supported-languages-and-frameworks) that the GitLab Static Analysis team actively manages, maintains, and updates. Below are the analyzer updates released during GitLab 14.7. These updates bring additional coverage, bug fixes, and improvements.

        - Spotbugs updated to v2.28.12 - [MR](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/spotbugs/-/merge_requests/121), [Changelog](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/spotbugs/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
          - Updates Log4j library to patched version (v4.5.3). See our [updated blog post](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/12/15/updates-and-actions-to-address-logj-in-gitlab/) for more information.
        - Code Climate updated to v0.85.26 - [MR](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/78125), [Changelog](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ci-cd/codequality/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#anchor-08526)

        If you [include the GitLab managed vendored SAST template](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#configure-sast-in-your-cicd-yaml) ([`SAST.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml)), you do not need to do anything to receive these updates. However, if you override or customize your own CI/CD template, you need to update your CI/CD configurations. To remain on a specific version of any analyzer, you can [pin to a minor version of an analyzer](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#pinning-to-minor-image-version). Pinning to a previous version prevents you from receiving automatic analyzer updates and requires you to manually bump your analyzer version in your CI/CD template.
