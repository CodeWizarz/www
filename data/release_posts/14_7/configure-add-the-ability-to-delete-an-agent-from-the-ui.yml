    description: |
      The [GitLab Agent for Kubernetes](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/clusters/agent/)
      is tested and adopted by hundreds of GitLab customers each month. A few users
      noticed that it's not straightforward to remove a registered agent from GitLab.
      Until now, the agent could be removed only through the GraphQL API.
      Introduced in GitLab 14.7, you can delete an agent directly from the GitLab UI
      as well.

      When you delete the agent, GitLab revokes its tokens and the
      given connection stops working immediately.
