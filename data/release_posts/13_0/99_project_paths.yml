      With the introduction of [subgroups](/solutions/subgroups/), GitLab's URL path structure became more complex. We've been [introducing a separator](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/214217), `/-/`, to improve clarity between groups, projects, and pages within a project. For example, `https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues` is now `https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues`. These changes result in improved performance, stability, and simplicity. 

      As we introduce the separator to additional pages, we automatically redirect requests to the old paths to the new ones. With GitLab 13.0, we are [removing this redirect](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/26808) for pages which have had the separator since GitLab 12.0.

      Regular usage of GitLab will not be impacted by this change. However bookmarks or scripting created over a year ago, utilizing an affected path, will need to be updated to utilize the new path.
