        GitLab supports six [syntax highlighting preferences](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/preferences.html#syntax-highlighting-theme) when viewing code. Themes are important to developers when viewing and editing code on GitLab since it's imperative that they work comfortably throughout the day. We've now released support for all six syntax highlighting preferences in the Web IDE. This includes [Solarized Dark](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/201927), [Solarized Light](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/201930), [Monokai](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/199883) and a [no highlighting](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/216543) option.

        Over the last few releases (for example, [12.8](/releases/2020/02/22/gitlab-12-8-released/#dark-syntax-highlighting-theme-for-web-ide) and [12.9](/releases/2020/03/22/gitlab-12-9-released/#white-syntax-highlighting-theme-for-web-ide)) we've been steadily adding and improving support for syntax highlighting preferences in the Web IDE. These updates follow this effort and help to lay the foundation for our [Dark Theme in the Web IDE](#dark-theme-in-the-web-ide), also launching in 13.0. We're excited to continue to expand on developer experience and making the Web IDE feel more like home.
