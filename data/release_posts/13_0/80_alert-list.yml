      description: |
        When responding to alerts, responders need a single interface that aggregates IT alerts originating from multiple sources. The new alerts list enables you to sort through alerts quickly and intuitively to help you find and triage the most critical problems first. You can access the alerts list at **Operations >> Alerts**.
