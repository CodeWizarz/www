      description: |
        We're pleased to announce the initial release of exportable vulnerability
        lists from the [Instance Security Dashboard](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/213014) and [Project Security Dashboard](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/197494).
        While the Security Dashboards let users manage vulnerabilities as part of
        the GitLab workflow, it hasn't been as easy to get a list of this information
        for external use.

        You can now download a CSV file containing the detected vulnerabilities
        for a given project or all projects configured on the Instance Security
        Dashboard. This export list can then be used for things such as creating
        compliance reports or as a data source for external dashboards.
        Simply go to the instance Security Dashboard or any [projectâ€™s Security Dashboard](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/security_dashboard/index.html#export-vulnerabilities) and click the new Export
        button in the upper-right or go to the Security option under the More menu
        in the top navigation bar, then click the new Export button in the
        upper-right. Your browser will automatically start the download.
