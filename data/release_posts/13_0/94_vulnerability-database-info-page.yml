        We know that understanding what GitLab scans for is important to ensure
        that you feel safe. With this release, we are introducing a [new page](https://advisories.gitlab.com)
        to give you more information about the vulnerability database our
        scanners use.
        
        From this page, you can get information about what we are scanning for,
        when we last updated our database, and also look up specific
        vulnerabilities you are concerned about.
