      description: |
        In GitLab 13.0, you can create dashboards powered by variables, enabling you to use a single dashboard to monitor multiple services and components, rather than creating hard-coded dashboards for each service you want to monitor. Instead of the time-consuming and repetitive task of recreating similar dashboards multiple times, you can now create a single dashboard and use variables to change the data you view in it.
