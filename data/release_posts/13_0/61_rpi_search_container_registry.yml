      description: |
        When you or someone on your team publishes an image to the GitLab Container Registry, you need a way to quickly find it and ensure the image was built properly. If you're using GitLab CI/CD to publish images with each build, it's been very difficult to find an image efficiently within the current user interface. Instead, you've relied on the command line or the [API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/container_registry.html#list-registry-repository-tags).

        We are excited to announce that in 13.0, we've added search functionality to the GitLab Container Registry. Simply navigate to your project or group's registry and enter an image name to see a list of all your images.
