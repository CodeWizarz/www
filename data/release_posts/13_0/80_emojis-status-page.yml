        GitLab issues support emojis in the issue title and all Markdown fields. When you publish a Gitlab issue to a public URL as a [status page](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/operations/incident_management/status_page.html), the status page now supports and renders emojis used in issue titles, descriptions, and comments.
