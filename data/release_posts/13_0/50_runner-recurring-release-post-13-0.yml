          We're also releasing GitLab Runner 13.0 today! GitLab Runner is the lightweight, highly scalable, cross-platform software agent agent that runs your build jobs and sends the results back to a GitLab instance. GitLab Runner works in conjunction with GitLab CI/CD, the open-source continuous integration service included with GitLab.
