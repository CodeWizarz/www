    description: |
      The GitLab Monitor tool was [renamed GitLab Exporter in 12.3](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/update/gitlab_12_changes.html#123) to prevent confusion with other monitoring-related features, and `gitlab_exporter` keys were added to `gitlab.rb`. The `gitlab_monitor` keys were deprecated in 12.3 and have been removed in 13.0.
