      description: |
        Passing environment variables (or other data) between CI jobs is now possible. By using the `dependencies` keyword (or `needs` keyword for DAG pipelines), a job can inherit variables from other jobs if they are sourced with `dotenv` report artifacts. This offers a more graceful approach for updating variables between jobs compared to artifacts or passing files.
