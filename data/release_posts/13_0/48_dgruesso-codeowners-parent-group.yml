        Groups can be used for organizing users in GitLab. This makes it easy to share projects,
        mention in comments, or assign as merge request approvers without selecting them one at a time.

        Groups and users can be assigned as code owners, but ancestor groups could not be used.
        This meant assigning a parent group from the project hierarchy as a code owner had no effect.

        GitLab 13.0 introduces the ability to include users and groups from a parent or ancestor group in a
        project's `CODEOWNERS` file, providing more flexibility when specifying Code Owners'
        rules.
