    description: |
      To help streamline and simplify the setup of [GitLab Security Tools](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/#security-scanning-tools), we have introduced a new global variable `SECURE_ANALYZERS_PREFIX` which by default points at the GitLab registry. This variable replaces the now deprecated variables in SAST and Dependency scanning: `SAST_ANALYZER_IMAGE_PREFIX` and `DS_ANALYZER_IMAGE_PREFIX`. Support for these deprecated variables will be removed in a future release, so please migrate any usage to `SECURE_ANALYZERS_PREFIX`.
      You can [override this variable](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/#override-the-default-registry-base-address) to easily affect all security scanners at once. This is useful in situations where you are using your own registry images which is common in offline and air-gapped environments.
