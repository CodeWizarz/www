    description: |
      In GitLab Runner 12.7 we introduced the ability to allow a service alias from `config` in the Docker executor. In 13.0, the old structure (`--docker-services`) has been removed. This means that the option `gitlab-runner register --docker-services postgres` will no longer set the service, because the configuration is no longer an array of strings. You can find more details in [issue #6404](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/issues/6404).
