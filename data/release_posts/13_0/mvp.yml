    Sashi [contributed](https://gitlab.com/dashboard/merge_requests?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=merged&author_username=ksashikumar&milestone_title=13.0) a wide variety of improvements across several areas of GitLab during 13.0. Sashi's work helped improve [Versioned Snippets](#versioned-snippets), remove errors related to the Releases tag, minimize duplicate events sent by webhooks. Sashi also improved the [organization and readability of the code](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/31346/) by ensuring that each package format has unique models for storing metadata.

    Thanks for all these contributions [Sashi](https://gitlab.com/ksashikumar)!
