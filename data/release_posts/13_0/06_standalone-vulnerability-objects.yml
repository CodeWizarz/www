      description: |
        We are excited to announce the first feature release for Vulnerability
        Management, standalone vulnerability objects. With this release, weâ€™ve
        implemented a new vulnerability object model, enabling a whole new set 
        of capabilities that span the entire lifecycle of vulnerability
        management.

        One of the biggest benefits is each vulnerability occurrence will now
        have a unique URL, meaning a vulnerability can be directly linked to,
        shared, referenced, and tracked as the Single Source of Truth. On this page, you can change the status of a vulnerability to Detected, Confirmed, Dismissed, or Resolved. Another
        benefit is vulnerability occurrences will persist across scanner runs.
        Previously, running scans on the same branch would overwrite any
        previous findings with the new results. Persisting vulnerabilities will
        improve tracking, visibility, and cut down on duplication of findings
        between runs. It also enables the future ability to report on group and
        project vulnerability trends over time across a broad range of 
        variables.
