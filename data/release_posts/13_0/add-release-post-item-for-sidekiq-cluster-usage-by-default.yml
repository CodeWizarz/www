deprecations:
  - feature_name: The default method of invoking Sidekiq will be `sidekiq-cluster`

    description: |
      As [stated in the 12.10 release post](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/04/22/gitlab-12-10-released/#sidekiq-cluster-available-in-core), in GitLab 13.0 we have deprecated alternative
      ways of starting Sidekiq in favor of Sidekiq Cluster. Sidekiq Cluster provides additional options for managing Sidekiq queues and scaling.

      This enables [running multiple Sidekiq processes](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/operations/extra_sidekiq_processes.html#starting-multiple-processes)
      for Core instances (a previously EE exclusive feature). Multiple Sidekiq processes allow a GitLab instance to continue to scale vertically, and are often a good first step prior to adding additional nodes. In addition, this will allow us to simplify support and improve maintainability for GitLab.com.

      Directly invoking Sidekiq will no longer be supported as of 14.0.

      For more information on falling back to the old (deprecated) behavior,
      please refer to either [Omnibus](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/operations/extra_sidekiq_processes.html#disable-sidekiq-cluster) or
      [Helm charts](https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/charts/gitlab/sidekiq/index.html#cluster) docs.

      Bug reports in [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/scalability/-/issues/340) will be greatly appreciated.
