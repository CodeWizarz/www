      description: |
        We're introducing initial support for .Net Framework which will allow developers to enable [SAST Security Scans](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#overview) on additional types of .NET projects. Like our other SAST jobs, this will use Linux GitLab Runners. We plan to expand support to GitLab Windows Runners in a future release. Since introduction in GitLab 11.0, [SAST for .NET](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/4824) only contained support for .NET Core projects.
