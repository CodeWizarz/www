      description: |
        This powerful new chart allows teams to see how delivery is distributed across different types of work. Use labels to see how many features are delivered vs. bugs from release to release, or how many items a given team ships vs. another. By reflecting on the distribution of work delivered through the value stream, teams can tune their processes to better align with strategic objectives or better balance resources across teams.
