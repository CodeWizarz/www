      Now that users can create Release Evidence on demand, GitLab supports multiple Evidence objects, each of which exposes the summary_sha and filepath fields. The original Evidence object is accessible as the first instance of the multiple Evidence objects. Updates to 13.0 make it possible to continue using Release Evidence and to be able to leverage on demand evidence collection.
