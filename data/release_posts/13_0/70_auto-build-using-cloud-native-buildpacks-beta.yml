      description: |
        [Cloud Native Buildpacks](https://buildpacks.io/) are the next iteration of buildpacks. While GitLab currently defaults to Herokuish buildpacks, we intend to move Auto DevOps to Cloud Native Buildpacks when the project matures, to provide a future-proof and well-maintained solution to our users. With this release, you can opt in to use the beta for Cloud Native Buildpacks in Auto DevOps pipelines by setting the `AUTO_DEVOPS_BUILD_IMAGE_CNB_ENABLED` CI variable.
