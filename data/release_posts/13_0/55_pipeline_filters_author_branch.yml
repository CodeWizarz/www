      description: |
        Searching for pipelines triggered by a specific user or that ran on a particular branch is now easier than ever before. With a new filter feature on the pipelines page, it is now possible to filter by trigger author and/or by branch name. Being able to refine the pipelines view by applying these filters will help to stay informed of pipeline activities that matter most to you.
