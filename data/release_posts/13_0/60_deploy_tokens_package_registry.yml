        Deploy Tokens allow you to access your group's repositories, project's repositories, and container registries. Historically, the defined scopes of `read_repository`, `read_registry`, and `write_registry` have not allowed you to grant access to the GitLab Package Registry. As a result, DevOps teams have used insecure or expensive user-based workarounds.

        In GitLab 13.0, we are excited to announce more granular permissions for GitLab Deploy Tokens. You can now set read or write access for the Package Registry. You can also create and manage Deploy Tokens from within the GitLab application or by using the [API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/deploy_tokens.html).
