      description: |
        Previously, the translation of instance-level [default branch protection](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/7583) settings down into projects was confusing because, in certain scenarios, it created an unintuitive experience: developers could not push new commits to projects they could create. This made it difficult for organizations to strike a balance between mitigating risk and allowing carte blanche access to projects for all developers since the workaround required promoting them to Maintainer.

        Now, default branch protection can be set at the group level to provide better flexibility for administrators and group owners. Using a combination of default branch protection and default project creation settings, organizations can [find the right mix](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/7583#note_288469003) of autonomy and control, such as using custom default branch protection and allowing only maintainers to create new projects. This would allow developers to push new commits (not force push or delete a branch) to new projects, but allow maintainers to control project creation.

        This group-level configuration of default branch protection can [be disabled](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/settings/visibility_and_access_controls.html#disable-group-owners-from-updating-default-branch-protection) for organizations requiring more strict controls in place. By disabling the group-level setting for default branch protection, maintainers can apply more stringent controls on developer access and permissions.
