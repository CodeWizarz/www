        Easily navigating commits in large merge requests allows reviewers to be more efficient
        while reviewing on a commit-per-commit basis.

        The new commit navigation buttons allows users to seamlessly navigate between the current
        commit to the previous or next commit, making it more efficient to review merge request
        with a large number of changes.
