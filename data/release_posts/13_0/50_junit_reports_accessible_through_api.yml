      description: |
        A JUnit report can contain a wealth of information that can be used to update test plans, test execution history, and other artifacts which teams use to track the quality of their code. Updating those artifacts can be a painful, manual, process made worse by the fact that JUnit reports are only available to download from the GitLab UI.
        Starting in GitLab 13.0 users of the GitLab API will be able to access JUnit reports directly. This will enable users to parse JUnit data to create new issues or [update test execution history](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/quality/team-tasks/issues/387).
