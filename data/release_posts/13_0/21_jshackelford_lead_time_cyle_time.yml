      description: |
        Two key value stream metrics now give teams a baseline against which process improvement efforts may be measured so that they may more easily see the impact of process changes. Lead time measures the elasped time between a requested item and its delivery. Cycle time measures the length of the development cycle itself. By optimizing flow across the entire value stream, teams avoid moving a problem from one place to another and ship faster.
