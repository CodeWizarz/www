      In GitLab 11.11, we announced the deprecation of the Windows batch executor, Cmd shell, for the GitLab Runner in favor of PowerShell. In 13.0, we have deprecated the use of the Windows batch executor for the GitLab Runner. PowerShell is the default command shell when a new Runner is registered that uses the Windows executor starting with GitLab Runner 12.0. The Cmd shell remains included in future versions of GitLab Runner. However, any new Runner feature is to be tested and supported only for use with PowerShell. You can find more details in [issue #4163](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/issues/4163).
