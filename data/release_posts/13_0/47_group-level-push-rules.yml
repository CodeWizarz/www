      description: |
        Push rules provide additional control over what can and canâ€™t be pushed to your repository. They allow you to create custom operational standards that align with your organizational policies.

        Previously, push rules could only be set at the instance or project level, forcing admins to manage large numbers of people and projects independently. New group-level push rules will allow group owners a way to govern policy in a central location, while still providing individual project owners with flexibility.
