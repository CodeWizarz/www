    description: |
      As of GitLab 13.0, the `bin/authorized_keys` file used for SSH authorization is deprecated,
      replaced by `bin/gitlab-shell-authorized-keys-check`, which conducts the authorization through
      [fast lookup](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/operations/fast_ssh_key_lookup.html) instead.
      The deprecated method wasn't reliable as it doesn't check that the requesting user matches
      the expected user. The final removal is scheduled for GitLab 13.1, released next month (June 22nd, 2020).
