    due: June 22, 2020
    reporter: dhershkovitch
    description: |
      Starting in GitLab 13.0, InfluxDB is being deprecated in favor of Prometheus for GitLab self-monitoring metrics. Please update your configuration for GitLab reporting and visualizations to use Prometheus, which is installed by default on every GitLab instance.
