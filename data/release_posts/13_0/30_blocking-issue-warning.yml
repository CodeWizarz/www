      description: |
        In GitLab 12.8, we [introduced](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/02/22/gitlab-12-8-released/#blocking-issue-support) the ability to create dependencies between issues, where one issue can block another related issue. This means that the downstream issue should not be closed until the predecessor is completed and closed. This required you to check to see if an issue is blocked before you closed it.       

        Having to check if an issue is blocked prior to closing the issue is an
        additional step that is unnecessary and easy to forget.

        We've eliminated that step by showing you a warning if you attempt to
        close an issue with unresolved blockers. We also provide links
        to the blocking issues so you can verify that your issue is safe to
        close.

        This level of increased dependency alerts helps keep projects running
        smoothly, and ensures that sequencing of issues can be maintained!
