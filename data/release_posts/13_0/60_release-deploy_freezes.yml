      description: |
        In this milestone, GitLab introduces more controls for environments. With the Freeze Period API, you can easily prevent an unintended production release during a period of time specified by you, whether it is a large company event or holiday. You can now rely on the enforcement of policies that are typically outside the scope of GitLab to reduce uncertainty and risk while automating deployments.
