  - feature_name: "Deprecation of Docker-in-Docker (DinD) for Security Scanners"
    due: May 22, 2020
    reporter: tmccaslin
    description: |
      To increase the security and reduce complexity of scans, use of Docker-in-Docker (DinD) in GitLab Secure scanners has been deprecated. GitLab security products will begin to use non-DinD mode by default in vendored templates in GitLab 13.0. We encourage customers to update their vendored templates to use this new behavior. 
      If you want to continue using DinD mode instead, see [Enabling Docker-in-Docker for Dependency Scanning](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/#enabling-docker-in-docker-for-dependency-scanning). In a future release we intend to remove DinD completely. Please be aware of slight [changes in scanner detection logic](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/37453), which we have largely mitigated.
