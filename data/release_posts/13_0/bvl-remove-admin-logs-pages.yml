  - feature_name: Removal of logs view from the admin dashboard
    reporter: reprazent
    due: May 22, 2020
    description: |
      Logs can no longer be viewed from within GitLab admin dashboard. These logs
      used to be read directly from disk to be displayed in the admin
      interface. Sadly, this does not work in multi-node setups and
      could cause confusion for administrators by displaying partial
      information. The logs are still available to administrators with
      access to the host, please see [the documentation on our log
      system](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/logs.html#log-system)
      for more information. For multi-node systems we recommend ingesting
      the logs into services like Elasticsearch and Splunk.
