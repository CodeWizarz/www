      description: |
        If you use Terraform to define your infrastructure as code, you know the pain of having to pass around the resulting changes from your `terraform plan` command in slack and MR comments. In GitLab 13.0, you can now see the summary of your `terraform plan` command in the context where it is most useful, directly in your merge request. This helps you to more quickly verify your infrastructure changes and gives you a place to collaborate with your team members on the intended effects of your infrastructure as code changes.

        Users of the [Terraform template provided by GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Terraform.gitlab-ci.yml) will see the `terraform plan` merge request widget without additional configuration. Users of customized CI/CD templates for Terraform can update their template to use the image and scripts in the [official GitLab Terraform template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Terraform.gitlab-ci.yml).
