        Merge Requests, particularly the **Changes** tab, is where source code
        is reviewed and discussed. In circumstances where the target branch was
        merged into the source branch of the merge request, the changes in the
        source and target branch can be shown mixed together making it hard to
        understand which changes are being added and which already exist in the
        target branch.

        In GitLab 13.0, we are adding an experimental comparison mode, which
        will show a diff calculated by simulating a merge - a more accurate
        representation of the change than using the merge base of the two
        branches. The new mode is available from the comparison target drop down
        by selecting **master (HEAD)**. In the future it will
        [replace](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/198458) the
        current default comparison.
