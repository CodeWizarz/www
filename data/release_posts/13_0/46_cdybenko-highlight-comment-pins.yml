      description: | 
        When there are a lot of discussion threads on a design it can be hard to identify which thread relates to which comment pin on the design without scanning for the correct comment number. 
        
        In 13.0, we added a mechanism to highlight the relevant design discussion comment pin when you click on the comment. We also added the reverse where you can click on the comment pin and have the relevent comment scroll into view. This reduces manual scrolling and sifting through the noise when you have lots of comment pins.
