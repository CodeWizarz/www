      description: |
        [Browser Performance Testing](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/browser_performance_testing.html) allows users to easily detect when there is a degradation in their web app before merging to master. In many cases this causes extra noise and clutters up the Merge Request page unnecessarily, even for minor changes. 
        In this milestone, you can now set an optional degradation threshold as a requirement that must be met before the Performance report will be displayed.
