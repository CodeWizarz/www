    description: |
      In 12.0, we introduced a feature flag for the Docker executor that enabled you to continue using the method where volumes are not mounted to services. In 13.0, this feature flag has been removed and volumes will be mounted to services. You can find more details in [issue #6581](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/issues/6581).
