        We are continuing to make great strides improving the performance of GitLab in every release. Weâ€™re committed to not only making individual instances of GitLab even faster, but also to greatly improving the performance of GitLab.com, an instance that has over 1 million users!

        In GitLab 13.0 we are shipping performance improvements for issues, projects, milestones, and a lot more! Some of the improvements in GitLab 13.0 are:

        - [A comprehensive list of performance improvements to atomic processing of pipelines](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/197930#note_320405586)
