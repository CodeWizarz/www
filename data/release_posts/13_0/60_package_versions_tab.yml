      description: |
        The GitLab Package Registry has been treating each new version of a package as a *new* package. This has made it difficult to find the package you are looking for or to understand what has changed from version to version.

        In GitLab 13.0, we are excited to announce that each version of a package will now be nested under its uniquely-named parent. This will make it easier to find the package you are looking for in the UI and to better understand what has changed from version to version. This change applies to both the group and project-level views of the Package Registry. In addition, when using the [Packages API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/packages.html), versions will now be returned as an array within the parent package.
