      We began improving your wiki editing experience in GitLab 14.0, when we introduced the MVC of a new WYSIWYG Markdown editor. It supported the most common Markdown formatting options, but with some notable gaps. GitLab 14.1 continues to improve your editing experience for images and tables. You can now upload images directly into the editor. You can also insert and edit tables, including copying and pasting content from popular spreadsheet applications to bring tables from other sources into your wiki. â€‹
