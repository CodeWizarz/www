      We're also releasing GitLab Runner 14.1 today! GitLab Runner is the lightweight, highly-scalable agent that runs your build jobs and sends the results back to a GitLab instance. GitLab Runner works in conjunction with GitLab CI/CD, the open-source continuous integration service included with GitLab.

      #### What's new:

      - [Add support for Windows Server, version 20H2 (Semi-Annual Channel)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/issues/27220).
      - [Pass the job payload to the GitLab Runner custom executor](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/issues/4677).
      - [Stop considering Docker image pull as runner system failure](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/issues/27880).

      #### Bug Fixes:

      - [Docker jobs fail with exit code 137](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/issues/28001).
      - [Fix trace short writes for large log lines](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/merge_requests/2993).

      The list of all changes is in the GitLab Runner [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/blob/14-1-stable/CHANGELOG.md).
