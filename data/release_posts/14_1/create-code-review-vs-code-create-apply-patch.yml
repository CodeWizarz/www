      When reviewing a merge request (MR) it can be helpful to make suggestions to many of the changed files. This is often done by creating a patch file with the suggestions and sharing it with others. The problem is that this requires several manual steps like running Git commands and uploading the patch file somewhere others can download it.

      With [GitLab Workflow](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitLab.gitlab-workflow) [v3.26.0](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-vscode-extension/-/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#3260-2021-07-13) for VS Code you can now create and apply patches directly in your editor. The new `GitLab: Create snippet patch` command creates a patch with the changes in your editor and uploads that patch as a [GitLab snippet](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/snippets.html).

      Anyone can search for patches in the project's snippets and apply them directly in VS Code with the `GitLab: Apply snippet patch` command. The applied changes can then be committed to the MR.

      Sharing and collaborating around patches is a great way to propose more complex suggestions and provide clear improvements. Patches created in VS Code can also be linked to others through snippets and downloaded and applied outside of VS Code for users with different editing tools.
