    description: |
      Audit events are now created if a [GPG key](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/users.html#add-a-gpg-key) or [SSH key](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/users.html#add-ssh-key) is created using the API. This extends visibility beyond users that create keys using the GitLab UI to help you understand and secure all the ways GitLab could be accessed.
