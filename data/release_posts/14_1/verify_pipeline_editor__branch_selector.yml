    description: |
      Previously, you could only use the pipeline editor to work on your pipeline configuration in your project's default branch. In this release, we are adding a branch selector to the pipeline editor. Now you can use the pipeline editor from any branch you'd like, which makes it much easier to test changes before implementing them on the default branch.
