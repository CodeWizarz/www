    description: |
      Data in CSV (comma-separated value) files is easier to understand when shown as a table with columns and rows, especially if the file is large. Previously, CSV information was presented as raw text in GitLab repositories. CSVs are now represented as a table, with the RAW view representing the actual comma separated values.
