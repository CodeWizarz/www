    description: |
      As a part of our project to move to a browser-based DAST ecosystem, we have switched the DAST authentication method over to using browser-based authentication. In addition to supporting all of the existing DAST methods of authentication, this new system allows for advanced debugging by generating a report that contains screenshots and HTTP requests made during the authentication process. The report allows a user to view all the steps in the process and see what is happening if authentication fails. The new authentication method also contains quality-of-life improvements such as greater flexibility for how to select login form elements on a page, support for clicking elements to show a popup login modal, strategies for validating whether or not authentication succeeded, and direct access to the browser logs for debugging purposes.
