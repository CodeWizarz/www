    Andrew actively contributed numerous merge requests in the GitLab 14.1 release to help improve GitLab's planning capabilities. He was able to make some significant improvements to GitLab's issue and epic boards. Thanks to his work, GitLab users are now able to [sort epic lists by title](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/63767); view the number of [open issues, weight](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/61965), and [progress](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/64622) in epic boards; and [view milestone weights](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/64874) on milestone view lists.

    In addition to contributing to the product in key ways, Andrew collaborated closely with the team as he helped identify and fix all the bugs and barriers he encountered along the way.

    Thank you Andrew for helping to make GitLab better! ðŸ™Œ
