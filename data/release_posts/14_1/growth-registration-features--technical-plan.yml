      [Registration Features](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/service_ping/index.html#registration-features-program) introduces the ability for free, self-managed users running GitLab EE to access paid features by registering with GitLab and sharing activity data via [Service Ping](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/service_ping/index.html#what-is-service-ping). Features introduced here do not remove the feature from it's paid tier, or prevent users from accessing at that tier without sharing usage data. The first feature introduced is [email from GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/tools/email.html), enabling instance administrators to email users within their instance.
