    description: |
      Vault users can easily retrieve secrets from within GitLab CI/CD by using the GitLab Vault integration. The integration initially created `file` type secret variables, and this approach had a few shortcomings. To overcome these we are introducing a new boolean `file` keyword where you can specify if the returned variable should be stored as a plain environment variable or a file.

      This feature requires a GitLab Runner version 14.1.0. For backward compatibility, the default is to store the variables as file types (`file: true`).
