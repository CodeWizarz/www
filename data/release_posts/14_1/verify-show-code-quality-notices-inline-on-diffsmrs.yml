    description: |
      If you're a developer authoring or reviewing a merge request, you want to know how every change
      impacts the quality of a project. To do this within GitLab, you previously needed
      two windows open:

      1. On the code diff of the merge request.
      2. On the main merge request page to see the code quality changes.

      This back-and-forth is inefficient, and makes it easy to miss critical code quality issues.

      The merge request **Changes** tab now shows you which line introduced a code quality violation, and its severity, so you can quickly identify the most critical issues to resolve. Hovering over the icon provides details about the violation.
