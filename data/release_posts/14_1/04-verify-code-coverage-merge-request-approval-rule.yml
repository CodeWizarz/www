    description: |
      To keep code test coverage high, you need to ensure that merge requests to your codebase never decrease test coverage. Previously, the only way to enforce this was to [require approvals](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/approvals/#required-approvals) from users who would check for test coverage decreases as part of their reviews.

      Now you can enforce this organizational policy with the new Coverage check approval rule. This is a simple way to ensure merge requests that would decrease test coverage cannot be merged.
