    description: |
      When responding to feedback on a merge request in Visual Studio Code, it wasn't easy to know which files had comments. You had to open each file and search for comments.

      With [GitLab Workflow](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitLab.gitlab-workflow) [v3.24.0](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-vscode-extension/-/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#3240-2021-06-30) for VS Code, we now indicate which files have comments in the merge request. This helps you easily identify the files you may need to review, to address their comments.
