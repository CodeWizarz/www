    description: |
      As part of the larger effort to rename Git's default initial branch in a GitLab project from `master` to `main`, we are adding an automatic redirect to streamline the transition. Previously, when projects renamed the default branch, current URLs would result in `404 Not Found`. This is a frustrating experience when you are trying to navigate between branches. Now, if you navigate to a file or directory path whose default branch was renamed, you will be redirected to the updated path automatically.
