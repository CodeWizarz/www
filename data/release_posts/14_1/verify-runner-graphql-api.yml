    description: |
      Previously, to manage runners programmatically, you had to fetch and manipulate data by using a REST API. As part of our plans to improve the administration of runners, we are implementing GraphQL as one foundational element in delivering a better user experience in the runner's Admin Area UI. With this release, you can now use GraphQL queries and mutations to administer runners for your GitLab instance programmatically.
