      In GitLab 14.1, we are cleaning up and [removing old code](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/63994) that was specific for browsers that we no longer support. This has no impact on users when one of our [supported web browsers](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/install/requirements.html#supported-web-browsers) is used.

      Most notably, support for the following browsers has been removed:

      - Apple Safari 13 and older.
      - Mozilla Firefox 68.
      - Pre-Chromium Microsoft Edge.

      The minimum supported browser versions are:

      - Apple Safari 13.1.
      - Mozilla Firefox 78.
      - Google Chrome 84.
      - Chromium 84.
      - Microsoft Edge 84.
