    description: |
      Linking directly to a single, highlighted line of code or text supports collaboration on a single line, but discussions often address multiple lines of code or text. Some code editor plugins, such as [GitLink](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8183-gitlink) for JetBrains IDEs, generate an anchor link from a selected range over multiple lines. Previously, you couldn't use such links in GitLab repositories, because GitLab and GitHub have incompatible formats for anchor links highlighting multiple lines. Previously, only manually modifying the incompatible URL in GitLab enabled highlighting multiple lines. GitLab now supports both GitLab and GitHub formats for code highlight anchor links that cover multiple lines.
