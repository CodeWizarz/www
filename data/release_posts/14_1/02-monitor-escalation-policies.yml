    description: |
      Being on-call is a stressful, 24/7 job. It's possible to miss a notification despite your best efforts and intentions. Teams that maintain critical systems can't afford to miss alerts for outages or service disruptions. Escalation policies are a safety net for these situations. Escalation policies contain time-boxed steps that automatically page a responder in the next escalation step if the responder in the step before didn't respond. To protect your company from missed critical alerts, create an escalation policy in the GitLab project where you manage on-call schedules.

      In GitLab 14.1, users can create, view, or delete escalation policies.
