      In GitLab 14.0, we introduced the Content Editor in the Wiki, a new WYSIWYG Markdown editor with support for basic content types like **bold**, _italic_, `code`, block quotes, and links. In 14.1, we're adding the ability to format text with strikethrough and insert [horizontal rules](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/328627). Adding these frequently-used content types brings us closer to our goal of giving all users a rich editing experience without learning Markdown, with [full support for the GitLab Flavored Markdown specification](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5438), to make this the default editing experience for the Wiki.
