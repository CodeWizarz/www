    description: |
      Commenting on a single line is great for simple kinds of code review feedback, but often a comment addresses multiple lines in the diff. For instance, a portion of a logic block, a paragraph of prose, or an entire function. This forces users to choose a single line to provide feedback, but the feedback refers to other portions of the file.

      Previously, users could select multiple lines after posting a comment by adjusting line numbers up and down from the original comment point. Now, users can click at the beginning of a line and drag the comment marker across multiple lines to highlight and reference multiple lines when leaving feedback in a merge request.
