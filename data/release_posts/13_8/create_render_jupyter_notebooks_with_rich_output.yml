    description: |
      Jupyter notebooks are documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. They are widely used for data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and more. They are capable of using "rich output" to show an object's rendered representation, such as HTML, JPEG, SVG, or LaTeX files. Previously, opening the notebook in Jupyter was the only way to read it with rich output.

      GitLab 13.8 now shows rich output for Jupyter notebook content by default. This is an excellent way both to preview changes to your files as well as consume Jupyter notebook without ever having to leave GitLab.
