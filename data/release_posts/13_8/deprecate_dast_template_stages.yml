- feature_name: "Remove DAST default template stages"

  description: |
    In GitLab 14.0, the stages defined in the current `DAST.gitlab-ci.yml` template will be removed to avoid the situation where the template overrides manual changes made by DAST users. This change is being made in response to customer issues where the stages in the template cause problems when used with customized DAST configurations. Because of this removal, `gitlab-ci.yml` configurations that do not specify a `dast` stage must be updated to include this stage.

    In GitLab 13.8, the stages are deprecated and the changes to remove them from the template are included in the `DAST.latest.gitlab-ci.yml` template. Anyone can test and see if any changes are needed in their configuration files.
