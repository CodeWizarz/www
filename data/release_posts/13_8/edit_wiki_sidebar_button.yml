      Creating a Markdown file named `_sidebar` in the Wiki will use the contents of that file to generate a custom sidebar navigation menu for your project. Editing this file, however, was tricky as there was nowhere in the interface to open `_sidebar` again.

      Thanks to a wonderful community contribution from GitLab user [Frank Li](https://gitlab.com/lifrank1994), starting in GitLab 13.8 there is now an **Edit sidebar** button in the top right of the Wiki page. Clicking this button will automatically create the `_sidebar` file if it doesn't already exist and open it in the page editor. With this quick access, it is more intuitive to create and easier to maintain your custom Wiki navigation.
