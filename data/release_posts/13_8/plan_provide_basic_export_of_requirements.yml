    description: |
      After completing development and verifying your product meets all requirements, it may be necessary to export the requirement status to allow for incorporation into a higher level requirements traceability analysis. With the introduction of the requirements export feature, this is now possible! Simply initiate the requirement export and they will be automatically sent to you in .CSV format, ready to import into other tools or provide to your customer.

      This is the first iteration of this feature, so please provide feedback and follow along in the [Requirements Export Epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4672).
