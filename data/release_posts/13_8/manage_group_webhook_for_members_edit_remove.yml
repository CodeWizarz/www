    description: |
      In GitLab 13.7, we introduced a [webhook](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/12/22/gitlab-13-7-released/#group-webhooks-for-members-mvc) that is triggered when a new member is added to a group. In GitLab 13.8, the group member events webhook will also be triggered if the access level of a user has changed, the expiration date for user access has been updated, or a user has been removed from the group. With the addition of these events, the group member events webhook can be used to be aware of all changes made to group members without relying on API calls which put unnecessary performance load on your GitLab instance.
