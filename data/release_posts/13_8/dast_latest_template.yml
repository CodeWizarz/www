    description: |
      GitLab's DAST has always had only a single template that isn't versioned and is updated whenever we need to change things. This has proven difficult for users whose tests break after a template update. Starting in GitLab 13.8, we introduce a `.latest` version of the template. This template includes all template changes made between major releases, including breaking changes. This gives users a warning that changes are coming and enables them to test the changes for themselves before being forced to switch.

      Breaking changes are brought into the stable template on the next major GitLab version. For non-breaking changes, these can be brought into the stable template after living in the latest template for a few releases. The speed at which the changes are incorporated into the stable template depends on a number of factors and takes into account feedback from users as they test the changes in the latest template.
