  description: |
    Every Git repository has an initial branch. It's the first branch to be created automatically when you create a new repository. By default, this initial branch is named `master`. Git version 2.31.0 (scheduled for release [March 15th, 2021)](https://www.google.com/calendar/event?eid=NG03dTF0YWU4cnMyMmc5bzJoMjVyYTZwcXEgamZnYmwybXJsaXBwNHBiNmllaWgwcXIzc29AZw&ctz=America/Los_Angeles) will change the default branch name in Git from `master` to `main`. In coordination with the Git project and the broader community, GitLab will be changing the default branch name for new projects on both our Saas (GitLab.com) and self-managed offerings starting with GitLab 14.0. This will not affect existing projects.
