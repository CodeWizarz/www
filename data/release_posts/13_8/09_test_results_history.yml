      description: |
        When you're reviewing the results of a Merge Request's pipeline execution, there may be test failures to investigate further. It's often hard to validate whether a test failure is accurate and needs to be fixed, or if it's simply a flaky test that can be ignored. Figuring this out can be even more difficult when you're not dealing with a brand new test failure.

        The first minimal viable change for the repeat failed test counter will provide you a count of how often a test has failed in previous pipelines on the Test Summary Merge Request Widget. We are requesting feedback from the wider community in [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/242233) to understand what we can improve in future iterations of this feature.
