    description: |
      When viewing a commit in GitLab, the merge requests containing the commit are linked. Finding the merge request that added the commit is very useful when you are trying to find the business and technical context of a change.

      If you use squash or merge commits, merge request information was not previously included. GitLab 13.8 now includes merge request links for all commit types, ensuring you can find where a change was introduced.
