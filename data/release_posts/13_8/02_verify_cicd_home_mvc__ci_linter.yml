    description: |
      The CI lint tool validates your pipeline syntax and provides you with some details about each job. Previously, CI lint was located on the jobs page which was difficult to find and access. In this release, accessing this tool is much easier than before because it is now included as a part of the new Pipeline Editor. With this improvement, you can easily use CI lint while editing your configuration and quickly validate that your syntax is what you want before committing the changes.
