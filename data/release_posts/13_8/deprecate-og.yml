    description: |
      We have enabled a deeper integration with Opsgenie and other alerting tools through [HTTP endpoint](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/operations/incident_management/alert_integrations.html#generic-http-endpoint) integrations so you can see alerts within the GitLab interface. As a result, the previous link to Opsgenie in the alerts list has been [deprecated](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5056) in this release.
