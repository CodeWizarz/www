    description: |
      Many teams use boards to manage issues during an iteration. In 13.6, we added support for [filtering issues on a board to a specific Iteration](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/118742), but it is cumbersome to remember to apply that filter every time you go to your board.

      In this release, we've added the ability to scope your board to the currently active iteration.
