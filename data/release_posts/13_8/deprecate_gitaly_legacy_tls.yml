  due: January 22, 2021

  description: |
    Support for TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 has been [deprecated and removed from GitLab for security reasons](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2018/10/15/gitlab-to-deprecate-older-tls/). We will do the same for Gitaly as there are cases where the minimum TLS version was not set and was therefore defaulted to TLS 1.0.

    Gitaly will be configured to use TLS 1.2 at a minimum for all client and server-side connections.
