    description: |
      If you use Terraform to set up GitLab, we are happy to announce version 3.4.0 of [the GitLab Terraform Provider](https://github.com/gitlabhq/terraform-provider-gitlab/releases). In the past months, the provider received support of project mirroring, group sharing, project approval rules, and instance-level CI variables, besides many smaller enhancements and a few bug fixes.
