    description: |
      When you enter `/` into a description or comment field, all available [Quick Actions](https://gitlab.com/help/user/project/quick_actions) are now displayed in a scrollable list. Quick Actions are a great way to efficiently update data on an issue, merge request, or epic, and this small improvement helps them be more discoverable in the context in which they are used.
