    description: |
       A complex CI configuration can be difficult to understand as a developer, especially when trying to predict how your pipeline might behave (or misbehave). Without a visual aid, it is challenging to form a mental image of the relationships between all of the jobs and determine how they are interconnected. In our first iteration of a pipeline visualization, you can now see a graphic representation of your `.gitlab-ci.yml` configuration to better understand and predict how your pipelines will perform.
