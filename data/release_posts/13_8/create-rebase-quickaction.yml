      [Rebase](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/git/git_rebase.html#regular-rebase) is a Git command used to reapply commits on top of a new commit. In practice, this means reapplying commits from a feature branch on top of the latest version of the target branch (e.g. `main`). In this way, it is possible to bring the feature branch up to date and resolve any conflicts without using a merge commit resulting in a simpler linear Git history.

      GitLab 13.8 brings the ability to execute the rebase [quick action](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/quick_actions.html) in merge requests, allowing you to quickly invoke the rebase Git utility.

      On a merge request comment, type `/rebase` and click the **Comment** button. It's that simple.
