    description: |
      When available from our security scan analyzers, GitLab [Static Application Security Testing](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/) provides severity data for identified vulnerabilities. We recently updated our JavaScript analyzer, ESLint, to add support for severity and CWE data. This data will help increase the usability and accuracy of [Security Approval Rules](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/#security-approvals-in-merge-requests) as fewer vulnerabilities will report 'Unknown' severity. Additionally, this data is shown on vulnerability detail pages providing more information and links to relevant information about vulnerabilities making it easier for developers to understand and remediate issues. 
      In the future, we will [augment other analyzers missing vulnerability metadata](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4004) and add a mechanism to allow [customized vulnerability metadata](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/235359) enabling organizations to tailor results to match their risk profiles.
