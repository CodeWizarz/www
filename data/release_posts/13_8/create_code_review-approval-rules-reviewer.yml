    description: |
      When working to have your merge request reviewed, approved, and finally merged, it's important to select the right people to perform those tasks. Asking for a review from people who can't provide the approvals can slow down the process of delivering your contribution.

      From GitLab 13.8 onwards, when selecting a reviewer for your merge request, you can see which approval rules that the user matches displayed right below the reviewer's name.
