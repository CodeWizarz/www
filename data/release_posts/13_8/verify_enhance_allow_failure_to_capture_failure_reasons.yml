    description: |
      You can use the `allow_failure` keyword to prevent failed jobs from causing an entire pipeline to fail. Previously, `allow_failure` only accepted boolean values of `true` or `false` but we've made improvements in this release, so now you can use the `allow_failure` keyword to look for specific script exit codes. This gives you more flexibility and control over your pipelines, preventing failures based on the exit codes.
