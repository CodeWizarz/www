      description: |
        Keeping the latest artifact from the most recent successful job is a useful default behavior but can also result in significant amounts of storage usage. This can cause an unexpected surge in disk space usage if you have pipelines that generate large artifacts. To improve storage consumption management, you can now disable this behavior for any project in the settings.
        
        Coming up next, [gitlab#276583](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/276583) will allow you to entirely disable keeping the latest artifacts at the instance level.
