    description: |
      Processing incidents during a fire-fight requires responders to coordinate across multiple tools to evaluate different data sources. Collecting and assessing metrics, logs, and traces - and sharing these with a response team - is time-consuming and challenging. We've streamlined this workflow by providing drag-and-drop uploads for these screenshots in a new **Metrics** tab on incidents. Aggregate and centrally locate all your screenshots of metrics so your team can quickly access and reference important charts.
