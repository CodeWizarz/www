      description: |
        Previously it was not possible to run pipelines for branches first, then switch to [merge requests pipelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/merge_request_pipelines/) when the MR is created. Consequently, with some configurations, a push to a branch could result in duplicate pipelines if a merge request was already open on the branch: one pipeline on the branch and another for the merge request. Now you can use the new `$CI_OPEN_MERGE_REQUESTS` predefined environment variable in your CI configurations to switch from branch pipelines to MR pipelines at the right time, and prevent redundant pipelines.
