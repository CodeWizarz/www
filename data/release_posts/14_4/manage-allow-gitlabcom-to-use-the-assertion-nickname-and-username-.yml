    description: |
      Previously, usernames in SAML assertion attributes on GitLab.com were derived from the
      user's email address. Now the user's GitLab.com username is used when the SAML response
      includes a `username` or `nickname` attribute. This allows for more flexibility in defining GitLab usernames when using an Identity Provider.
