    description: |
      You can use the GitLab Dependency Proxy to proxy and cache container images from Docker Hub for faster, more reliable builds. The problem is that, over time, your team may add a lot of items to the cache. This can result in higher storage costs.

      You've been able to work around this by using the [API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/dependency_proxy.html) to purge the entire cache. But that's inefficient because you only want to remove old, stale items that are no longer in use. That's why we've added cleanup policies for the Dependency Proxy. Now you can programmatically delete image tags from the cache that haven't been recently used by your team.

      Simply configure the number of days and all cached dependency proxy files that have not been pulled in that many days are deleted. We recommend 90 days as a good starting point. The cleanup policies for the Dependency Proxy can be set using the GitLab GraphQL API. We're currently working on [adding this setting to the user interface](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/340777) as well.
