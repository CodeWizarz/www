      Filter scoped labels with a wildcard to quickly find issues, epics, or merge requests that all share the same key from a set of scoped labels. You can also pair wildcard filtering with `!=` (is not) to easily filter down items that do not have any label from a set of scoped labels. To filter with a wildcard, just append `*` after typing in your scoped label key (for example, `label::*`).
