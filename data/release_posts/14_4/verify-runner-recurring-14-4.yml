        We're also releasing GitLab Runner 14.4 today! GitLab Runner is the lightweight, highly-scalable agent that runs your build jobs and sends the results back to a GitLab instance. GitLab Runner works in conjunction with GitLab CI/CD, the open-source continuous integration service included with GitLab.

        #### Bug Fixes:

        - [Pod label name cannot contain special characters with Kubernetes executor](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/issues/4565).
        - [GitLab Runner ignores the runtime configuration for service containers](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/issues/27168).
        - [Consider all Docker image pull errors as a script failure rather than a system failure](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/issues/28075).
        - [S3 cache failure in AWS China (Beijing) region](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/issues/28085).

        The list of all changes is in the GitLab Runner [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/blob/14-4-stable/CHANGELOG.md).
