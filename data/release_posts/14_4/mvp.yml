    [Ethan](https://gitlab.com/firelizzard) leapt in and offered to contribute remote repository support in VS Code for GitLab hosted projects. This effort was no small feat and consisted of not [one](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-vscode-extension/-/merge_requests/321), not [two](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-vscode-extension/-/merge_requests/333), [three](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-vscode-extension/-/merge_requests/337) or [four](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-vscode-extension/-/merge_requests/338) merge requests, but [five](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-vscode-extension/-/merge_requests/351) total contributions to add this feature.

    Ethan has also been a consistent contributor in both issues and other merge requests to [GitLab Workflow](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitLab.gitlab-workflow) for VS Code helping to both contribute code and respond to users with questions and issues. Ethan even picked up a bug fix after shipping remote repositories that a user reported so that the feature worked well for all.

    Thanks for everything you've done to help support [GitLab's VS Code extension](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-vscode-extension)!
