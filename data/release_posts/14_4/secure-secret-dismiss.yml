    description: |
        The current implementation of Secret Detection automatically resolves findings (marking them as fixed) for every secret detection scan that is run by diffing between pipeline executions. With the introduction of [historic secret scanning](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/secret_detection/#full-history-secret-detection) in [GitLab 13.0](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/05/22/gitlab-13-0-released/#secret-detection-for-the-full-history-of-a-repository) we do not want to automatically resolve findings because this effectively erases secret vulnerabilities that are still present in the Git history.
        This change in behavior will improve the usability of the historic secret detection while also providing more clear audit trails for normal secret detection and align the [vulnerability management](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/security_dashboard/) of secret detection findings with our other security scanners.
