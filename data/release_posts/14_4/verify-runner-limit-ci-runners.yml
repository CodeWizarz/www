      description: |
        In GitLab 13.12, we started rolling out this feature, limiting the number of runners registered to a group or project. As of 14.4, this feature is now fully enabled on GitLab.com and limits the number of registered runners to 1,000. For self-managed administrators, this means you can implement limits at the group and project level, which will help reduce the administrative overhead resulting from teams registering new runners while not removing inactive runners.
