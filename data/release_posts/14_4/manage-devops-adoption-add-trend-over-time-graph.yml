    description: |
      In GitLab 14.4, we added a new graph to group-level DevOps Adoption for trend over time. This graph shows you how groups adopt DevOps features over time and can give insights into how quickly groups are adopting additional DevOps processes. This is broken down by Dev, Sec, and Ops functionality.
