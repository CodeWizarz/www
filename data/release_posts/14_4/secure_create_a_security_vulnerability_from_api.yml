    description: |
      GitLab's vulnerability management capabilities make it easy to triage and remediate security issues detected by our [security scanning tools](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/#security-scanning-tools) or from integrated 3rd-party tools. One limitation of this approach is that the vulnerability data can only come from the output of one of these tools. Organizations wishing to pull in other vulnerability source information currently do not have a simple option for doing so.

      We are addressing this limitation with the introduction of new GraphQL properties for vulnerability object creation. You now have a way to programmatically add external vulnerability records directly to your projects. Combined with our existing GraphQL capabilities for vulnerability management, this opens up many new automation opportunities, such as syncing with an external bug bounty program or adding findings from security tools that may not be suitable for pipeline jobs, providing a more comprehensive view of a project's security vulnerabilities.
