    description: |
      GitLabâ€™s Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) now supports scheduled on-demand scans. Previously, on-demand DAST scans could only be manually triggered, which limited the usability to scans that you wanted to run immediately. With this new scheduler, you can set a DAST scan to run either once at a specific time in the future, or on a recurring basis. If adding DAST to your pipelines is not an option for your organization, or if the security or compliance regulations for your area require a scan to be scheduled, this feature provides an easy way to create a scheduled scan to meet your needs. The scan can be associated with the default branch, which allows for the results to show on the Secure Dashboard and Vulnerability list. Combined with the scan and site profiles, the scheduled on-demand scans give you quick and easy access to DAST results for your application or API, on a schedule that works for your development and security teams.
