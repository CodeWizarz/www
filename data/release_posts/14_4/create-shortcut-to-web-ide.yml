      Now it's even easier to take advantage of the powerful Web IDE and contribute to a project from your web browser. Simply press the `.` (dot) key on your keyboard to open the Web IDE with the current context loaded and ready to edit. Whether you're navigating individual files in the repository or reviewing a merge request, this is a great way to start editing without taking your hand off the keyboard.
