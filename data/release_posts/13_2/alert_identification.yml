      description: |
        Teams maintaining IT services receive hundreds or thousands of alerts a day. GitLab now de-duplicates and organizes your incoming alerts, providing you counts of alerts while keeping your alert list manageable and useful. Your alerts are linked to the incidents created from the alerts, helping you track which alerts have been addressed and which alerts still need to be triaged.
