      description: |
        For organizations using Jira as their primary work tracking tool,
        it can be a challenge for contributors to work across multiple systems
        and maintain a single source of truth.

        In this extension of our current Jira integration, project admins can now
        choose to display a list of Jira issues natively inside the GitLab
        project. This allows developers working primarily in GitLab to remain in
        flow, without having to reference a second tool for tracking what work
        needs to get done. Further planned enhancements include commenting, status
        changes (transitions), and more.
