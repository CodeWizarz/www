      description: |
        GitLab is expanding our [12.6 Release Evidence](/releases/2019/12/22/gitlab-12-6-released/#automated-release-evidence-collection-to-support-audits) feature by adding CI test results. These job artifacts, generated by the pipeline, are automatically included in the release evidence JSON file. As an Ultimate user, you will be able to effortlessly provide an auditor or compliance process with the relevant changes to production. You can download the evidence JSON and show corresponding test results organically as a part of using GitLab without disrupting your normal workflow.
