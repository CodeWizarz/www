        We're also releasing GitLab Runner 13.2 today! GitLab Runner is the lightweight, highly-scalable agent that runs your build jobs and sends the results back to a GitLab instance.
        GitLab Runner works in conjunction with GitLab CI/CD, the open-source continuous integration service included with GitLab.
