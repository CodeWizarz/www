      description: |
        When triaging an incident or validating the status of your service, you must be able to explore Kubernetes pod logs from across your entire application stack. Previously, the GitLab user interface displayed only the deployed application logs (logs that originate from the application you deployed to a cluster using CI/CD). In GitLab 13.2, you can now also search across your [managed application](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/clusters/applications.html) logs directly from the GitLab user interface.
