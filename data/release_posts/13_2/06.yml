      description: |
        You can now organize a collection of related confidential issues into a
         confidential epic. For customers working in areas like finance, HR, or security, there is often
        a need to work on items that can't be public or openly viewable. To better support customers 
         managing multiple confidential issues that all roll up to a shared goal or project, we have expanded our
         confidential functionality to epics!
