  - feature_name: "Transitioning GitLab Bandit Secure analyzer OS image"

    description: |
      In an effort to [simplify and modernize](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/secure/static-analysis/sast/#whats-next--why) our [GitLab Secure SAST Analyzers](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#supported-languages-and-frameworks), we will transition the [GitLab Bandit Python Analyzer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/bandit) image from Debian Buster to [Alpine Linux](https://alpinelinux.org/about/). This transition will reduce the image size and increase both the speed and security of our analyzer.
      
      This transition will be backward incompatible though we expect limited impact. If you use a `before_script` to pre-build dependencies for your Python project, you should test this change before upgrading to GitLab 13.4. We will add a new section in the [SAST troubleshooting documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#troubleshooting) with more information about this change as we approach 13.4.
