        In 12.10, we introduced a way for you to automatically create release tags from the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file. Now we've made it easier and more natural to use by exposing the `release` keyword as a step the GitLab Runner can parse. You no longer need to add a script to call the Release API to create a release. Instead, you can simply add the correct parameters to your CI/CD file.
