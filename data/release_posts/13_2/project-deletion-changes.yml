        In GitLab 13.2, we've improved the project removal experience to be consistent across all pricing tiers and introduced a group-level toggle to allow you to enable a deletion delay period before permanent removal. Previously, the default behavior for removing a project was different across Tiers. Projects would be immediately removed in the Free/Core and Bronze/Starter Tiers and delayed by 7 days in the Silver/Premium and Gold/Ultimate Tiers.

        Now, this behavior is consistent across the board and removing a project will result in the immediate removal of that project. To ensure you still have flexibility in this workflow, we've introduced a group-level toggle to "Enable delayed project removal" for groups and projects where preventing data loss is a key requirement. Deleting a project should be easy when it needs to be and have safeguards in place for organizations with stricter requirements around preserving their intellectual property.
