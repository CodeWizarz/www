      description: |
        In the 9.1 release, we added [Service Desk](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2017/04/22/gitlab-9-1-released/#service-desk-eep) to our Premium tier, allowing teams to connect directly with external users through email.

        Listening to our customers, we learned that Service Desk is a useful feature for teams of any size. In GitLab 13.2 you can now enable Service Desk regardless of your GitLab tier.
