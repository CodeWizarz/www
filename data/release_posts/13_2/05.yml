        PHP developers need a mechanism to share and consume their projects' dependencies. Composer is a dependency manager for PHP that allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage them for you.

        We are proud to offer a Composer Repository built directly into GitLab. PHP Developers now have an easier way to discover and manage their projects' dependencies. By integrating with Composer, GitLab provides a centralized location to view those packages in the same place as source code and pipelines. PHP dependencies in the Package Registry will be listed under the `All` tab and not under a Composer-specific tab. We will iterate to improve this by [adding a Composer-specific tab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/222469) in an upcoming milestone.

        Special thanks to [@ochorocho](https://gitlab.com/ochorocho), who has been a significant contributor to this feature. We could not have done it without his help and guidance.
