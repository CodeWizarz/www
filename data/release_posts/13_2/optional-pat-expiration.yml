      description: |
        You can now toggle enforcement of PAT credential expiration when a [lifetime limit](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/settings/account_and_limit_settings.html#limiting-lifetime-of-personal-access-tokens) is defined and met or exceeded by a personal access token. This optional enforcement provides flexibility to organizations for how they wish to manage credential rotations. This change is part of a [larger solution](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3084) to make credential management in GitLab both effective for organizations and friendly for developers.
