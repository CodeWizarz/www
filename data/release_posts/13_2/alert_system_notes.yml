      description: |
        When you change the status of an alert, assign it to a team member, or create an issue from the alert, GitLab tracks these events and displays them as notes on alert detail pages. Notes provide helpful context to responders, enabling your team to better collaborate when triaging alerts, and preventing unnecessary duplication of work.
