      description: |
        Historically, the `environment:action` keyword did not accurately represent environment jobs that didn't result in a deployment, such as in-approval jobs and building images for future deployments. In GitLab 13.2, jobs now contain a `prepare` keyword to make the state of non-deployment environment jobs clearer, keeping them accurate and representative of your deployment activities.
