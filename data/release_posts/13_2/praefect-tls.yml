    description: |
      Gitaly Cluster now supports [Transport Layer Security (TLS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security), which means all communication between Gitaly and its clients, GitLab and Praefect, are encrypted when TLS is enabled for both Gitaly and Praefect components. This is helpful when deploying GitLab to a network with other internal services that are not trusted.

      Previously, communication between GitLab and Gitaly supported TLS encryption, but encryption was not supported when using Praefect, which is a component of Gitaly Cluster.
