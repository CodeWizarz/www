        If you add a merge request to a Merge Train, but the system removes it due to an issue, you now receive a notification in the form of a To-Do task. This means you can add an MR to a Merge Train with confidence, knowing that either a merge will happen automatically, or you will receive a notification of failure. If the merge is unsuccessful, you can quickly correct errors and resubmit your MR instead of being surprised later to learn it was never merged.
