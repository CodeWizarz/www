      description: |
        Prior to this release, there was no way to associate an issue with more than one timebox in GitLab. This has been particularly problematic for teams that follow Scrum or XP. Such teams often need to associate issues with iterations/sprints, while also rolling that issue up to longer-running milestones, such as program increments. 

        Instead of having to decide whether to use milestones for sprints or program increments and track the other in a spreadsheet, you can now assign issues to iterations, milestones, or both.

        This is the first MVC towards a [longer term
        vision](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2422#mvc-user-flow)
        we have for empowering teams to more effectively use timeboxes to move
        from plan-driven to value-driven development.

        We'd love to [get your feedback and
        input](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/221284) on where
        you'd like to see Iterations go next!
