        With the new `exclude` syntax, you can prevent specific files from being added to artifacts. This eliminates the need to explicitly reference the path of every folder that should be added to the artifact (to avoid including too much). Support for wildcards (globs and double star globs) makes it easy to exclude entire subdirectories.
