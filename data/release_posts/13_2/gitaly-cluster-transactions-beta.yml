      description: |
        Gitaly Cluster allows Git repositories to be replicated on multiple warm Gitaly nodes. This improves fault tolerance by removing single points of failure. However, because write operations are currently replicated asynchronously, the GitLab server only has one copy of the change initially.

        In GitLab 13.2, transactional write operations to Git repositories can be enabled for Gitaly Cluster. When this option is enabled and an update is pushed to GitLab, the write operation will be proxied to the replica Gitaly nodes. The write operation will be coordinated between the Gitaly nodes using the two-phase commit protocol, so that they agree on the new state of the repository. Write transactions are currently limited to operations pushed over the HTTP and SSH Git interfaces, and does not include write operations via the GitLab interface like the Web IDE.
