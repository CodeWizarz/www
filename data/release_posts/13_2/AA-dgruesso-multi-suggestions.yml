        [Suggesting changes](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/discussions/#suggest-changes)
        in merge requests makes proposing improvements easy, but if you receive
        many suggestions, applying them one by one is slow.

        With Batch Suggestions, you can apply multiple suggestions at once, which is faster and
        easier! It's also beneficial to keep the commit history in a merge request clean and tidy.
        Thanks [Jesse Hall](https://gitlab.com/jessehall3) for your
        [contribution](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/merge_requests/22439)!
