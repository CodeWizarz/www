      description: |
        To understand system performance, your development team must monitor the health and performance of the underlying infrastructure. We want our metrics solution to be available to all GitLab users, so as part of our [2020 gift](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2019/12/16/observability/), we've moved cluster health in the Monitor stage from GitLab Ultimate to GitLab Core. Beginning with GitLab 13.2, all users can connect a cluster and monitor its health in the GitLab user interface.
