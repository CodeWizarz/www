      description: |
        In the 9.3 release, GitLab added [Code Quality scanning](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2017/06/22/gitlab-9-3-released/#gitlab-code-quality) to our Starter/Bronze tier, allowing you to see code quality changes directly in your merge requests. Since then, our users have provided feedback that this data is valuable to teams of any size, including individual contributors. In 13.2, you will be able to see Code Quality reports in your Merge Requests regardless of your GitLab tier.
