        If you’re collaborating as a team with Confluence, it can be hard to keep track of both your Confluence Workspace and the GitLab Projects that you use it on.  In 13.2, we’ve added a Confluence integration that links your project's left sidebar directly to a Confluence Workspace in a new tab.
