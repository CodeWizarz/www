      description: |
        GitLab users without Maintainer access currently cannot interact with Terraform commands, including `terraform plan`, which creates an execution plan useful in development workflows. In GitLab 13.2, users with the Developer role gain read-only access to the Terraform state API, enabling more users to contribute without risking improper usage.
