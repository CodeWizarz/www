      description: |
        Often Git users heavily rely on file diffs to observe, review, and track changes to content.
        In GitLab 13.2, we've added support for viewing diffs on Wiki pages. You can seamlessly see
        line-by-line content changes between two versions through the wiki commit history.

        Thanks to [Steve Mokris](https://gitlab.com/smokris) and [Greg](https://gitlab.com/gwhyte) for the contribution!
