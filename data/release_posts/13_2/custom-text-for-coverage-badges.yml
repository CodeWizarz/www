      description: |
        Projects that use multiple coverage badges, but are calculating different values for each, could only use `coverage` as the text for every badge. This made it cumbersome to figure out what that value means.

        Now, as a project maintainer or owner, you can customize the text for coverage badges to better differentiate between multiple coverage badges displaying on your project.

        Thank you to [Fabian Schneider](https://gitlab.com/fabsrc) for the contribution!
