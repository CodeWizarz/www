    Jesse contributed the new [Batch Suggestions](#batch-suggestions)
    feature which allows MR reviewers to group all suggestions made to a diff and submit them at once. Because each
    suggestion translates into a Git operation, submitting these individually could take a long time if there
    were a large number of suggestions. Submitting suggestions in batches has numerous advantages, including time
    savings, efficient CI resource utilization (only one pipeline for all suggestions), and preventing an overly
    noisy Git history.

    Thank you Jesse for the great effort, patience, and persistence getting this one over the line. We greatly
    appreciate it.
