    description: |
      Some vulnerabilities need to be addressed in bulk.  Whether they are false positives or no longer detected, it's important to minimize the noise and triage vulnerabilities with ease.
      With this release you can bulk change the status and make a comment for multiple vulnerabilities from a group or project Vulnerability Report.
