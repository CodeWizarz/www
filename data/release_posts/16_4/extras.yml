  - title: "GitLab releases are moving to the third Thursday of the month"
    description: |
      Starting with GitLab 16.6, which will be released on Nov. 16, 2023, **our monthly release date will change from the 22nd of every month to the third Thursday of every month**. This iteration in our release processes will ensure consistency and create more predictability for our customers in terms of the day of the week for the release while continuing our monthly pace of self-managed releases.

      Please see more information in our [blog post](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2023/09/18/gitlab-release-date-change/).
