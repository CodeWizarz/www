    description: |
      Allowing developers access to Kubernetes clusters requires either developer cloud accounts or third-party authentication tools. This increases the complexity of cloud identity and access management. Now, you can grant developers access to Kubernetes clusters using only their GitLab identities and the agent for Kubernetes. Use traditional Kubernetes RBAC to manage authorizations within your cluster.

      Together with the [OIDC cloud authentication](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/cloud_services/) offering in GitLab pipelines, these features allow GitLab users to access cloud resources without dedicated cloud accounts without jeopardizing security and compliance.

      In this first iteration of cluster access, you must [manage your Kubernetes configuration manually](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/clusters/agent/user_access.html). [Epic 11455](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/11455) proposes to simplify setup by extending the GitLab CLI with related commands.
