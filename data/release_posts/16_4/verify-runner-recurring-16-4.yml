        We're also releasing GitLab Runner 16.4 today! GitLab Runner is the lightweight, highly-scalable agent that runs your CI/CD jobs and sends the results back to a GitLab instance. GitLab Runner works in conjunction with GitLab CI/CD, the open-source continuous integration service included with GitLab.

        - [Add queue duration histogram metric to the runner Prometheus metric endpoint ](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/issues/36627)
