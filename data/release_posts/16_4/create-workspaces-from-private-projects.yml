    description: |
      Previously, it was not possible to [create a workspace](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/workspace/configuration.html#set-up-a-workspace) for a private project. To clone a private project, you could only authenticate yourself after you created the workspace.

      With GitLab 16.4, you can create a workspace for any public or private project. When you create a workspace, you get a personal access token to use with the workspace. With this token, you can clone private projects and perform Git operations without any additional configuration or authentication.
