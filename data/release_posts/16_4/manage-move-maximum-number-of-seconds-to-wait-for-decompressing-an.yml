    description: |
      We recently turned a few hardcoded import limits into configurable application settings to allow self-managed
      GitLab administrators to adjust these limits according to their needs.

      In this release, we've added the timeout for decompressing archived files as a configurable application setting.

      This limit was hardcoded at 210 seconds. On GitLab.com, and for self-managed installations by default, we've set this limit to 210 seconds. Both self-managed GitLab and
      GitLab.com administrators can adjust this limit as needed.
