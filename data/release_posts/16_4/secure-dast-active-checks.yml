    description: |
      Browser-based DAST active check 22.1 has been enabled by default. It replaces ZAP check 6, which has been disabled. Check 22.1 identifies "Improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory (Path traversal)", which can be exploited by inserting a payload into a parameter on the URL endpoint, allowing for arbitrary files to be read.
