      Geo now supports unified URLs on [Cloud Native Hybrid](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/reference_architectures/#cloud-native-hybrid) sites, which means that Cloud Native Hybrid sites can share a single external URL with the primary site. This delivers a seamless GitLab UI and Git developer experience for your remote teams who can be automatically directed to the optimal Geo secondary site based on their location using a single common URL. With this update, unified URLs are now supported across all GitLab reference architectures.
