    description: |
      If you need to trigger a downstream pipeline from a CI/CD pipeline job, you can use the `trigger` keyword. To enhance your deployment management, you can now specify an environment with the `environment` keyword when you use `trigger`. For example, you might trigger a downstream pipeline for the `main` branch on your `/web-app` project with environment name `dev` and a specified environment URL.

      Previously, when you ran separate pipelines for CI and CD and used the `trigger` keyword to start the CD pipeline, specifying environment details was not possible. This made it hard to track deployments from your CI project. Adding support for environments simplifies deployment tracking across projects.
