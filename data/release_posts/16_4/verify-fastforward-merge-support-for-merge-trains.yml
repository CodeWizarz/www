    description: |
      [Fast-forward merge](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/methods/#fast-forward-merge) is a common and popular merge method which avoids merge commits, but requires more rebasing. Separately, Merge Trains are a powerful tool to help with some of the greater challenges related to frequently merging into the main branch. Unfortunately, before this release you could not use merge trains and fast-forward merge together.

      In this release, self-managed admins can now enable both Fast-forward merge and merge trains in the same project. You can get all the benefits of merge trains, which ensure all your commits work together before merging, with the cleaner commit history of fast forward merges! 
      
      To enable the Fast-forward merge trains, locate the feature flag `fast_forward_merge_trains_support`, which has been disabled by default, and enable it.
