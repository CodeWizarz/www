      When upgrading to GitLab 16.4, any users who have not upgraded their security policy projects to use security bots must unlink and relink the security policy project from each group, sub-group, or project they have linked to refresh the connection.

      This can be configured using the [`Mutation.securityPolicyProjectUnassign` GraphQL mutation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/graphql/reference/#mutationsecuritypolicyprojectunassign) and [`Mutation.securityPolicyProjectAssign` GraphQL mutation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/graphql/reference/#mutationsecuritypolicyprojectassign) or by utilizing the UI. Once completed, a security policy bot will be enabled in all projects where a security policy is enforced and will become the author of any scheduled scan execution pipelines.
