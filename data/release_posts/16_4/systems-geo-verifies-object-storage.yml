    description: |
      Geo adds the ability to verify object storage when [object storage replication is managed by GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/geo/replication/object_storage.html#enabling-gitlab-managed-object-storage-replication). To protect your object storage data against corruption, Geo compares the file size between the primary and secondary sites. If Geo is part of your disaster recovery strategy, and you enable GitLab-managed object storage replication, this protects you against data loss. Additionally, it also reduces the need to copy data that may already be present on a secondary site. For example, when adding an old primary back as a secondary site.
