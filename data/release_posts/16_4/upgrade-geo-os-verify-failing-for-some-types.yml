     The introduction of [verification of object storage files in Geo](#geo-verifies-object-storage) results in the detection of orphaned upload records and as a result, you may notice primary checksum failure for some uploads. The most likely cause of these failures is orphaned upload records. Orphaned upload records are a result of the parent record, such as [Design Management](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/design_management.html) or [Vulnerability Report](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/vulnerability_report/), having not been deleted together with the associated upload record leaving behind a parentless upload record. Prior to object storage verification being available, only orphaned upload records related to local storage were detected.
      
      In most cases, removing the upload record along with the associated file in object storage is safe and is not a data loss concern. It is recommended that each failure is investigated and confirmed to be obsolete before deletion.
