    description: |
      Group Owners or administrators can now create and remove custom roles using the UI under the Roles and Permissions menu. To create a custom role, you add [permissions](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html#custom-role-requirements) on top of an existing [base role](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html#roles). Currently, there are a limited number of permissions that can be added to a base role, including [granular security permissions](#granular-security-permissions), the ability to approve merge requests, and view code. Each milestone, new permissions will be released that can then be added to existing permissions to create custom roles.
