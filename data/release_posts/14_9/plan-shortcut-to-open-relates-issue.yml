    description: |
      When creating a new issue from another issue, an option to mark the two issues as related is selected by default. This handy shortcut enables you to create one or more related issues without having to remember or copy-pasting issue IDs.

      Thanks for the contribution [Steve](https://gitlab.com/smokris)!
