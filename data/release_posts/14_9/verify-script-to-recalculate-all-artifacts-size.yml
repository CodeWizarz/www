    description: |
      Because of previous statistics calculations, the total artifact sizes shown in usage quotas might be incorrect. To ensure artifacts sizes are
      reporting accurately, we have added a background script on GitLab.com to automatically recalculate sizes.

      You may notice artifact statistics will fluctuate to `0` at times while the script is recalculating. After recalculation, statistics will return
      to normal.
