    [Timo](https://gitlab.com/tuxtimo) became a maintainer of the [Terraform provider for GitLab](https://github.com/gitlabhq/terraform-provider-gitlab) in February 2022. The Terraform provider allows an automated and codified management of GitLab users, groups and projects built on top of the GitLab APIs.

    Since he joined the team, he has been active in every part of the project and the community. In only the past month, he was the assignee on 24 merged pull requests in the Terraform provider project and he drove 5 releases of the provider (v3.10.0 - v3.12.0).

    Moreover, as provider users missed some GitLab APIs, Timo got his first contribution accepted to the core GitLab codebase and has 9 open MRs, all improving the GitLab APIs.
    
    Besides the development work, Timo supported other, new contributors on the Terraform provider, thus building a healthy and growing community where people are happy to contribute.

    Together with Timo, we would like to say thank you to [Adam Snyder](https://gitlab.com/armsnyder) too, the second most active maintainer of the Terraform provider for GitLab. Thank you Timo and Adam! ü§ù
