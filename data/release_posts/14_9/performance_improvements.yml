      In every release, we continue to make great strides improving GitLab's performance. We're committed to making every GitLab instance faster. This includes GitLab.com, an instance with over 1 million registered users!

      In GitLab 14.9, we're shipping performance improvements for issues, projects, milestones, and much more! Some improvements in GitLab 14.9 are:

      - [Implement SAX::Parser for cobertura parser](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/333442).
      - [Prevent top level group page taking > 10secs to load when there are a large number of sub-groups](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/355151).
      - [Separate milestone and epic queries when loading roadmap](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/220138).
