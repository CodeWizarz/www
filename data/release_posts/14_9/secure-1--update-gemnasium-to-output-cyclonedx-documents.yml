    description: |
      In order to align with a popular Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) industry format standard, Dependency Scanning's gemnasium analyzers will now output a CycloneDX SBOM for each supported lock or build file detected. These CycloneDX SBOMs are named `cyclonedx-<package-type>-<package-manager>.json`, and are saved in the same directory as the detected lock or build files. The CycloneDX SBOMs can be downloaded the same way as other job artifacts.
