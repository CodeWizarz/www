    description: |
      When running a manual job, it can be useful to input CI/CD variables to overwrite the existing variables, or to add new ones. Previously, the only way to do this, was to do it through the UI. In this release we've added the ability to specify variables when running a job by using the REST API, which will give you more options for automating your CI/CD pipelines.
