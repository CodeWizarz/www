    description: |
      In a previous release, we added the ability to create and manage project topics that are used to categorize projects and find similar new projects. However, we did not create a way to delete them. In this release, thanks to [Timo Furrer](https://gitlab.com/tuxtimo)'s contribution, we added an API endpoint to delete project topics to make topic management more neat and efficient.
