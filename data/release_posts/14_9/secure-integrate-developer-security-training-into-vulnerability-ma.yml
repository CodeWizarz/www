      GitLab provides a comprehensive set of [security scanning tools](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/#security-scanning-tools)
      that can identify all manner of security issues. Scanner findings are presented
      in merge requests, pipelines, and in a dedicated Vulnerability Report. When
      available, a recommended solution is given. However, this is not possible for
      all findings. Presenting security findings without guidance on how to fix identified
      problems or explaining the problem’s potential impact can be challenging for
      anyone not familiar with the specific security issue identified. This increases
      the time and friction involved in assessing and ultimately fixing security issues — especially
      in developer workflows.
      
      We’re pleased to announce the launch of our new
      integrated security training functionality. Two new partners are providing the
      training content. GitLab is already where many developers are working, so we
      designed a solution to provide context-aware security training options from
      inside the GitLab experience. 

      Simply enable security training for your projects, select your preferred content sources, and view the results from a security scan. In the vulnerability finding, you'll find a direct link to the security training that most closely matches the particular security issue, and the specific language or framework in which it was detected. Now developers can spend a few quick minutes reviewing targeted, context-relevant training to address security issues as part of their
      normal development workflow.
