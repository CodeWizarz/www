    description: |
      If you use the GitLab agent for Kubernetes, you must ensure that the `agentk` version installed in your cluster is compatible with the GitLab version. While the compatibility between the GitLab installation and `agentk` versions [is documented](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/clusters/agent/install/#upgrades-and-version-compatibility), until now it was not very intuitive to figure out compatibility issues. To support you in your upgrades, GitLab now shows the `agentk` version installed on the agent listing page and highlights if an `agentk` upgrade is recommended.
