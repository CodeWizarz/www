    description: |
      Previously, trying to have standard CI/CD templates that you reuse in many places was complicated because each template could only be included in a pipeline once. We dropped this limitation in this release, so you can include the same configuration file as many times as you like. This makes your CI/CD configuration more flexible as you can define identical includes in multiple nested configurations, and rest assured that there will be no conflicts or duplication.
