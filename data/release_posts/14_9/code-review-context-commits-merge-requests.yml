    description: |
      The best code reviews take into account the broader context and impact of changes, including previously merged commits. But it can be challenging to bring that context into merge requests, so that everyone can discuss how the proposed changes align with older changes.

      You can now stack previously merged commits onto the proposed changes in your merge request, to help you and everyone else understand the full context of the changes.

      Thanks to [Paulo Vitor Magacho](https://gitlab.com/pvmagacho), [Anwar Sadath](https://gitlab.com/asadath1395) and [Abhishek Kumar](https://gitlab.com/akumar1503) for all working to contribute this!
