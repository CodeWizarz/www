    description: |
      You can now monitor merge request approval activity that happens on the merge requests in your groups and projects. You
      can see which merge requests are being approved and by whom, if you need to refer back to that later.
      
      Because of the volume of data we expect to be generated by these events, they are only
      available as [streaming audit events](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/audit_event_streaming.html).
