    description: |
      Markdown content destined for your GitLab wiki is sometimes created outside of GitLab. In the "classic" wiki editor, you can paste valid Markdown with no problem, because you are working with the raw source. The page only renders when you submit the content. In the wiki WYSIWYG editor, however, your clipboard's content might have been pasted in as plain text, forcing you to manually reformat every line to remove Markdown syntax and re-format it using the WYSIWYG tools.

      In GitLab 14.9, the Markdown content you paste into the WYSIWYG editor using <kbd>Command</kbd> / <kbd>Control</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd> is parsed and rendered as rich text. You can still force the content to paste as plain text using <kbd>Command</kbd> / <kbd>Control</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd>.
