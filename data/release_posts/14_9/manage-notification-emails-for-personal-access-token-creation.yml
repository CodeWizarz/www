      Users want to be aware when new personal access tokens are created for and new email address are added to their account. In GitLab 14.9,
      a user's primary email address is sent a notification when:

      - A new personal access tokens is created for their account.
      - A new email address is added to their account.
      
      This acts as an extra layer of security and can serve as a warning of suspicious activity.

      Thank you [Riccardo Padovani](https://gitlab.com/rpadovani) for your contribution!
