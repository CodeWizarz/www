    description: |
      Prior to this update, to refer to the latest release of a project, users needed to know the exact version number. We have now added a link to the latest [release](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/releases/) for a project. This makes it much easier and more efficient to navigate to the latest release.
