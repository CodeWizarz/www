    description: |
      The CI/CD job token stored in the `CI_JOB_TOKEN` CI/CD variable makes authenticating API calls within jobs more intuitive, enabling advanced automation. For example, the token can be used with bot automation projects that run pipelines in other projects. The token is short-lived, but has the same permissions as the user that triggered the pipeline.

      In an effort to make its usage even more secure we are adding a setting that lets you define a list of trusted projects that you allow to use job tokens to access your project. This added layer of security means that only these projects will be able to access your project's API with a job token. In the bot automation example, it lets you control which bot projects can interact with your own project.

      This setting is currently disabled by default in existing projects to avoid impacting pipelines, but we strongly recommend enabling it in all your projects. It is enabled by default for all _new_ projects.
