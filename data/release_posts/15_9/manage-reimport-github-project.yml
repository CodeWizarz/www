    description: |
      Previously, it was not possible to import projects from external providers more than once.
      Now you can import projects from external providers many times using different target paths.
      The re-imported project doesn't override or merge with previously imported project.
      External providers include GitHub, Bitbucket Cloud, Bitbucket Server, FogBugz, and Gitea.
