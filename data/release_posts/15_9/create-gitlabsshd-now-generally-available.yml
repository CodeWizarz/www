      `gitlab-sshd` is a standalone SSH server, written in Go, that provides more insight
      and control than OpenSSH. It's lightweight and contains minimal external dependencies.
      If you host a self-managed instance, switching from OpenSSH to `gitlab-sshd` gives you
      metrics collection, detailed logging, and graceful shutdowns for SSH connections.
      Unlike OpenSSH, it supports the PROXY protocol and can pass on the original IP address
      when operated behind a proxy. This enables you to [restrict SSH access by IP address](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/access_and_permissions.html#restrict-group-access-by-ip-address)
      when your instance is operated behind a proxy.

      GitLab.com has used `gitlab-sshd` since 15.2,
      and 100% of the SSH traffic passes through `gitlab-sshd`. To learn more, read
      [this blog post](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2022/08/17/why-we-have-implemented-our-own-sshd-solution-on-gitlab-sass/).
      To understand how to enable it refer to [the documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/operations/gitlab_sshd.html).

      `gitlab-sshd` began as a community contribution from @lorenz.
      Thank you very much for your contribution!
