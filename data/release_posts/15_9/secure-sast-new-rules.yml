    description: |
      We've added new rules to GitLab SAST for Go, Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, and Python.
      The new rules add better protection against potential SQL injection, resource exhaustion, and directory traversal vulnerabilities, and identify insecure configurations in common libraries.

      The updated rules are included in the latest release of the Semgrep-based SAST analyzer.
      If you use the [default GitLab-managed CI/CD template for SAST](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Jobs/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml) on GitLab 15.0 or higher, your pipelines automatically update the Semgrep-based SAST analyzer to use the new rules.

      On your first scan after the update, new findings may be created for these new rules.
