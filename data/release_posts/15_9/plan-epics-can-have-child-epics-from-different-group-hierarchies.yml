    description: |
      Until now, epics could only contain sub-epic children from the same group. This was limiting and inconvenient for users who are trying to manage, organize, and communicate on large scale projects that have different sub-initiatives in other groups.

      As a continuation of improving cross-functional workflows, you can now add child epics from unrelated groups to a parent epic.
