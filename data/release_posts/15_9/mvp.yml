    Kyle Edwards contributed the ability to set custom text in a [user deactivation email](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/355964). This feature allows customers to specify why a user account was deactivated, and what steps to take for reactivating it. Kyle was praised for following GitLab's collaboration value.

    "When Kyle was doing the user deactivation email work he was very collaborative with our review process and kept the MRs moving, including writing docs ASAP in order to get the feature over the line for [%15.9](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/-/milestones/803#tab-issues)," said [Hannah Sutor](https://gitlab.com/hsutor), Sr. Product Manager at GitLab. "The efficient back and forth is truly appreciated, and we recognize that he does not have to do this as a contributor."

    Kyle's past contributions to GitLab include the [runner token rotation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/runners/configure_runners.html#authentication-token-security), which was recognized by GitLab's [Security Awards Program](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/security/security-awards-program.html). Kyle was also recognized for the contribution of `.strong_memoize_attr()` and RuboCop changes made to enforce its use.

    Kyle works at Kitware as co-maintainer of the [CMake buildsystem](https://cmake.org/). He joined the GitLab community in 2019 and has been making regular code contributions to GitLab since 2021.

    Our thanks go out to Kyle, our latest MVP, for all the amazing work contributing to GitLab ðŸ™Œ
