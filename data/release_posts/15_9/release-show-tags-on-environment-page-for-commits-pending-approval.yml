    description: |
      The first iteration of showing related tags for a deployment only supported completed deployments. With this release, you can now see tags for deployed commits in the Environment page for deployments that are pending approvals as well. This information helps provide the people involved in executing and approving the deployment with more context about what is being deployed.
