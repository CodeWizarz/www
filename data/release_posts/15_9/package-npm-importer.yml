            Have you been thinking about moving your npm registry to GitLab but haven't been able to invest the time in planning a migration? GitLab is proud to announce the MVC launch of an npm package importer. You can now create a `config.yml` file that defines the packages you want to import from any npm compliant registry into GitLab, such as Artifactory. Then you add the importer to a `.gitlab-ci.yml` pipeline configuration file, and the importer does the rest. It runs in the pipeline, dynamically generating jobs that import all the packages into your GitLab package registry.
