    description: |
      Previously it was impossible to mask variables containing certain special characters, for example `$`, `'`, or `"`. This sometimes prevented masked variables from being used for keys or passwords which typically contained one of those characters. In this release, we've removed that masking limitation for non-expanded (raw) variables. Note that the value still has an 8-character minimum length, and must not use spaces.
