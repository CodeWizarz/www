    description: |
      While using GitLab, you may have noticed that some pages don't have a left sidebar. These pages are primarily user-orientated pages such as your assigned items (issues, merge requests, and to-do items) as well as pages related to your work environment such as groups, projects, and activity. Not having a left sidebar on those pages creates some inconsistency and layout shifting within GitLab.

      In this release, we've added a new **Your work** sidebar to add consistency and a dedicated place in our navigation for the things you are working on.

      This new sidebar paves the way for our [navigation redesign](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9044), where the top navigation will move into the left sidebar.
