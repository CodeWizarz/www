    description: |
      You can now filter [epic lists](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/epics/manage_epics.html#filter-the-list-of-epics) and [roadmaps](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/roadmap/#sort-and-filter-the-roadmap) to show epics from a specific group. This makes it more efficient and flexible to target the information you need.
