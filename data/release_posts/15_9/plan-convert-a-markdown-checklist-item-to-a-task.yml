    description: |
      Teams often use Markdown checklist items to outline tasks or completion
      criteria for an issue, but tracking more in-depth information related to the checklist item has always been limited and cumbersome. With the release of 15.9, you can seamlessly convert a Markdown checklist item in an issue to a task, enabling teams to have a more robust experience tracking and managing an issue's dependencies by assigning and estimating tasks separately from issues.
