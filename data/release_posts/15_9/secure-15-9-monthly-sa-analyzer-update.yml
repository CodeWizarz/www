        GitLab Static Analysis includes [many security analyzers](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#supported-languages-and-frameworks) that the GitLab Static Analysis team actively manages, maintains, and updates. The following analyzer updates were published during the 15.9 release milestone. These updates bring additional coverage, bug fixes, and improvements.

        - KICS-based analyzer updated to version 1.6.7. See [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/kics/-/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v376) for further details. This version includes new rules, bug fixes, and improvements.
        - Kubesec-based analyzer updated to version 2.12.0. See [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/kubesec/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v344) for further details.
        - PMD Apex-based analyzer updated to version 6.53.0. See [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/pmd-apex/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v332) for further details.
        - Secrets analyzer updated to version 8.15.2. See [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/secrets/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v457) for further details. This version also improves the detection rule for Google Cloud service account keys.
        - Semgrep-based analyzer updated to improve debug logging. See [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/semgrep/-/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v3130) for further details.

        If you [include the GitLab-managed SAST template](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#configure-sast-in-your-cicd-yaml) ([`SAST.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml)), you don't need to do anything to receive these updates. However, if you override or customize your own CI/CD template, you need to update your CI/CD configurations.

        To remain on a specific version of any analyzer, you can [pin to a minor version of an analyzer](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#pinning-to-minor-image-version). Pinning to a previous version prevents you from receiving automatic analyzer updates and requires you to manually bump your analyzer version in your CI/CD template.

        For previous changes, see [last month's updates](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2023/01/22/gitlab-15-8-released/#static-analysis-analyzer-updates).
