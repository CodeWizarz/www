    description: |
      GitLab Service Desk makes it easy to interact with customers and provide support.
      To ensure that customer email addresses are kept private, you now need to have at 
      least the Reporter role in a project or group to see the sender address of a Service Desk issue.
      This applies to both public and private projects.
