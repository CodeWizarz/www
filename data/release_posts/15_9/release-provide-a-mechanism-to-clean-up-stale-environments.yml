    description: |
      You can now more easily stop and clean up stale environments in your projects. Using the [API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/environments.html#stop-stale-environments) or [UI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/environments/#stop-an-environment-through-the-ui), you can stop all environments that have not been modified since a specified date, excluding protected environments. You can use this to manage the number of environments in your project and keep only the relevant environments in the project.
