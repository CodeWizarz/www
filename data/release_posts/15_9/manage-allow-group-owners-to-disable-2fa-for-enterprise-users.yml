    description: |
      Previously, when a user lost access to their two-factor authentication (2FA), that user had to ask GitLab support to reset their 2FA. Now, group owners are able to disable 2FA for [enterprise users](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/enterprise_user/index.html). After a user's 2FA is disabled, that user is prompted to set it up again.
