    description: |
      The SCIM API now returns the [`:active` attribute for each user](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/scim.html#get-scim-identities-for-a-group). Group Owners can now use this attribute to distinguish between active and inactive users, which is useful as a user can be outside of their group, but still have a SCIM identity.
