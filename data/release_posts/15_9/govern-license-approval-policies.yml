        GitLab now supports flexible license approval policies as the replacement for the [deprecated License-Check feature](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/update/deprecations.html#license-check-and-the-policies-tab-on-the-license-compliance-page). License approval policies improve the experience over the License-check feature in several ways:

        - Users can choose who is allowed to edit license approval policies.
        - Multiple policy rules can be created and chained together.
        - A two-step approval process can be enforced for any desired changes to license approval policies.
        - A single set of license policies can be applied to multiple development projects, or can be applied at the group or subgroup level, to allow for ease in maintaining a single, centralized ruleset.
        - Policies can be used to require approval for any license that is not specifically allowed.

        License approval policies can be used alongside the existing License-Check feature, as the two policies are additive and don't conflict. To get started, verify that the `license_scanning_policies` feature flag is enabled for your instance and then navigate to **Security & Compliance > Policies**, create a new Scan Result type policy, and select **License scanning** for your policy rule.
