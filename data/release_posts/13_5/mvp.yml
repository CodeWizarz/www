    The [H-E-B Digital](https://digital.heb.com/) Security Engineering team contributed a new [GitLab Secure SAST Scanner integration](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#supported-languages-and-frameworks) which will add Static Application Security Testing (SAST) support for Mobile apps. [This contribution](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/233777) adds a highly requested capability of [SAST scanning for iOS and Android mobile apps](#sast-support-for-ios-and-android-mobile-apps) coded in Objective-C, Swift, Java, and Kotlin.

    We thank the H-E-B Digital team for their significant contribution that allows all GitLab customers to scan their mobile applications for security issues. Learn more about [integrating with GitLab Secure](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2020/10/22/integrating-with-gitlab-secure/).
