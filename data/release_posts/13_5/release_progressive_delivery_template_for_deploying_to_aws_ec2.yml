    description: |
      To help you deploy to AWS Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2) more efficiently, we created a template that shows you how to get started. This template allows you to provision your own infrastructure by first leveraging the [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) API. You then push your previously built artifact to an [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) bucket and deploy the content to an [AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) instance.

      Users can include the template in their configuration, specify a few variables, and their application will be deployed and ready to go in no time.
