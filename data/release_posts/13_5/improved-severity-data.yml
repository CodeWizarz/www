    description: |
      When available from our security scan analyzers, GitLab [Static Application Security Testing](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/) provides severity data for identified vulnerabilities. We recently updated our analyzers for NodeJS (nodejsscan) and C/C++ (flawfinder) to add support for severity data. This data will help increase the usability and accuracy of [Security Approval Rules](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/#security-approvals-in-merge-requests) as fewer vulnerabilities will report 'Unknown' severity.
      In the future, we will [augment other analyzers missing vulnerability metadata](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4004) and add a mechanism to allow [customized vulnerability metadata](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/235359) enabling organizations to tailor results to match their risk profiles.
