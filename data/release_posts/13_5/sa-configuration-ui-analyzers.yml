      The [GitLab SAST configuration UI tool](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/index.html#configure-sast-in-the-ui) has been extended to support additional setting options and can now update simple existing GitLab CI/CD files. We believe that [security is a team effort](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/secure/#security-is-a-team-effort) and this configuration experience makes it easier for non-CI/CD experts to get started with GitLab SAST. The tool helps a user create a merge request to enable SAST scanning while leveraging best configuration practices like using the GitLab-managed [`SAST.gitlab-ci.yml` template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml) and properly [overriding template settings](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#customizing-the-sast-settings).

      The Configuration UI now supports the configuration of [specific SAST analyzer settings](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/index.html#analyzer-settings) which allow organizations to tailor SAST results to their security preferences. The Configuration UI can now also update existing simple `.gitlab-ci.yml` files, allowing the tool to be used with projects that already have GitLab CI/CD setup. We will also [expand access to this tool to GitLab Core users](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/241377) in an upcoming GitLab release.
