      description: |
        There is now a limit to the number of tests that can be parsed from JUnit report-formatted files that are uploaded in one build for use in the Test Summary and Unit Test reports. For GitLab.com the maximum number of tests that can be parsed is 500,000 for all JUnit report formatted-files in a build.
