        For many teams, using GitLab wikis for planning and documentation is a critical part of their workflow. Wikis are so popular that they get over a million views each month on GitLab.com. Despite this popularity, teams have struggled with the limitation that wikis were only available at the project level. Teams working on multiple projects needed to create separate wikis for each repository, leading to a fragmented experience.

        In Gitlab 13.5, we are so excited to bring you group wikis! With [680 upvotes](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/13195) this was the most upvoted feature in the entire GitLab backlog. While highly requested, making a large project-only feature like wikis available at the group level has been a non-trivial operation. We’ve worked tirelessly over the past year to make it happen and now we can't wait to get it in your hands and hear your feedback.

        Group-level wikis open up tons of possibilities to keep your information at a higher level and accessible to a broader set of people. A few examples of what you can put in your group wikis include team-specific information, coding style guides, and designs for your brand or your company.

        We know a lot of folks have been looking forward to this feature and shared their input pre-release. We hope all of you will continue to weigh in now that group wikis are available and we’ve opened up a [dedicated issue for your feedback](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/267593).
