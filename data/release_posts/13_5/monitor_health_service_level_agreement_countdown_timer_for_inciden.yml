      Service level agreements (SLA) are important to keep for customers. SLA breaches can cost you revenue, and decrease customer satisfaction and confidence, but it's challenging to monitor SLA for multiple active incidents. The SLA countdown timer allows you to configure the length of your specific SLAs, and display SLA countdowns on Incidents to help ensure you meet your SLAs and keep your customers happy.
