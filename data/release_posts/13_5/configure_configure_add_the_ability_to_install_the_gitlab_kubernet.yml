    description: |
      Last month we introduced the [GitLab Agent for Kubernetes](/releases/2020/09/22/gitlab-13-4-released/#introducing-the-gitlab-kubernetes-agent) for self-managed GitLab instances installed with Helm.

      This release adds support for the [official Linux package](/install/). In this new Kubernetes integration, the Agent orchestrates deployments by pulling new changes from GitLab, rather than GitLab pushing updates to your cluster. You can learn more about [how the Kubernetes Agent works now](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/clusters/agent/) and [check out our vision](/direction/configure/kubernetes_management/) to see what's in store.
