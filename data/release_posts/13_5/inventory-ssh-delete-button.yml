      description: |
        Managing your namespace includes ensuring you know who has access and how. To promote the security of SSH keys, you should be able to delete a user's SSH key when appropriate. To support this control, we've added a delete button for self-managed administrators to delete these keys as needed.

        Now you can manage your users' SSH keys from the [Credential Inventory](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/credentials_inventory.html#credentials-inventory) from a single screen.
