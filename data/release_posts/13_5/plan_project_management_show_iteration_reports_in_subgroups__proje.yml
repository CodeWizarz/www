    description: |
      Iterations are currently created at the group level and there is no way to view an iteration's report within the context of a subgroup or project. This is problematic for organizations that operate according to the [principle of least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege). It also makes it difficult and confusing for a larger organization to use the same iteration cadence, while also providing a way for each group and project to track their progress.

      To solve this, iterations are now inherited down a group's hierarchy, providing each subgroup and project the ability to view an iteration report scoped to the context in which it's being viewed.

      This change also allows organizations to have more flexibility and control over how they want to use iterations. You can configure iterations from the top-level group to align all groups and projects on the same schedule, or each subgroup can manage its own iteration cadence independently.
