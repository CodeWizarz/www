      description: |
        When your pipeline fetches a lot of external dependencies (such as NPM), not having the option to cache dependencies on a failed pipeline means throwing away valuable cache that is otherwise unchanged by your code. Now you have the option to save the cache regardless of the job status, which can save time and resources when iterating on a failing pipeline.
        
        Caching only when the job/pipeline succeeds is still the default. This prevents an uncleared cache of incomplete dependencies from causing subsequent pipelines to fail. But now you can decide when it's safe to enable caching always, to support incremental builds and help speed up the process of getting to your first green pipeline.
