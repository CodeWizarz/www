      description: |
        Job logs often contain very long sections that make it difficult to parse when you are scanning the logs to find a specific piece of information.

        Now you can set job log sections to be collapsed by default. To make parsing much easier, simply add `[collapsed=true]` to your job scripts in your CI/CD configuration file as needed.
