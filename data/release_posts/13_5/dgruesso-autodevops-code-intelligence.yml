    description: |
      GitLab's built-in [code intelligence](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/code_intelligence.html) is a great way to easily add code navigation features to your project, improving your code review workflow with useful features such as type signatures, symbol documentation, and go-to definition.

      As part of GitLab 13.5, automatic setup and configuration of code intelligence for Go projects has been added to Auto DevOps. Once you run a new pipeline you will be able to take advantage of GitLab code intelligence. As more languages become available as part of the [LSIF standard](https://lsif.dev/), we plan to update Auto DevOps to support them. You can follow the [code intelligence epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4212) for future updates.
