        You can use the GitLab Conan Repository to publish and share C and C++ dependencies. But, when using the Package Registry user interface to find or verify a dependency, it was difficult to differentiate between different versions of a dependency. The user interface presented the name and version, but did not include `conan_user` or `conan_channel`. Both of these are often used to differentiate between different packages. For example, the below recipe would have been displayed in the UI as `Hello version 1.0`.

        - Hello/1.0@trizzi/stable
        - Hello/1.0@trizzi/beta
        - Hello/1.0@other_user/stable

        Now the entire recipe is displayed in the user interface, making it easier to find and verify the package you are looking for.
