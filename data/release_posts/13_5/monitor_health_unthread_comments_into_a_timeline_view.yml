    description: |
      GitLab comments and threads are a great way to collaborate on incidents, but how can you understand everything that happened in a chronological order from threaded discussions?

      You can now view discussions as a comment timeline to help your team understand the sequence of events during a fire-fight, and hold an effective post-incident review.
