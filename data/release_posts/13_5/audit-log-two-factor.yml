      description: |
        Full traceability and auditability of your GitLab namespace is critical to a successful security compliance program. It is important to know when a two-factor authentication attempt has failed, since it suggests that a user or bad-faith actor knows an account password but does not have access to the second factor device.

        In GitLab 13.5, you can now evaluate the number of failed two-factor authentication attempts to help inform your decisions. You can find failed two-factor authentication attempts tracked in the Audit Events table at the instance level. Support for group level is coming in a future iteration.
