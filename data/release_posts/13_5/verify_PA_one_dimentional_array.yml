        Previously, the `parallel: matrix` keyword, which runs a matrix of jobs in parallel, only accepted two-dimensional matrix arrays. This was limiting if you wanted to specify your own array of values for certain jobs.

        In this release, you now have more flexibility to run your jobs the way that works best for your development workflow. You can run a parallel matrix of jobs in a one-dimensional array, making your pipeline configuration much simpler. Thanks [Turo Soisenniemi](https://gitlab.com/Turmio) for your amazing contribution!

        Here's a basic example of this in practice that will run 3 test jobs for different versions of Node.js, but you can apply this approach to your specific use cases and easily add or remove jobs in your pipeline as well:
