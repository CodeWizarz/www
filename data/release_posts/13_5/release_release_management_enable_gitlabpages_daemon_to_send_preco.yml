    description: |
      If you are looking for ways to improve your GitLab Pages load times, we are excited to announce a great community contribution from [feistel](https://gitlab.com/feistel) and [Ambyjkl](https://gitlab.com/Ambyjkl) that adds support for Brotli compressed files. This helps lower the required bandwidth per page, improving your site load times.
