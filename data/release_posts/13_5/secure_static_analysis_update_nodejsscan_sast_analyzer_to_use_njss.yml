    description: |
      We have updated our Node.js SAST analyzer which adds 100+ new detection rules. This version also changes the detection rules to be powered by [v0.1.5](https://pypi.org/project/njsscan/0.1.5/) of [njsscan](https://github.com/ajinabraham/njsscan) and [semgrep](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep) which is now supported in our new [SAST Custom Rulesets](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#custom-rulesets).
