      description: |
        In GitLab 13.3, we introduced [project-level access tokens for self-managed instances](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/08/22/gitlab-13-3-released/#project-access-tokens), allowing access to a project without the need to provision a new user.

        We are now making project-level access tokens available in GitLab.com! Project access tokens can be generated by project Maintainers or Owners and be used to authenticate with the GitLab API and Git. Project access tokens will not increase the licensed seat count and are authorized as Maintainers. This new functionality will make programmatic access to GitLab easier, more secure, and less cost prohibitive.
