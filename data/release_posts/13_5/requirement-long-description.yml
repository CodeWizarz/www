        Requirements Management improves productivity when it's possible to add additional details such as verification criteria, acceptance criteria, and rationale from within your tool.

        GitLab Requirements Management now supports users adding detail information and content to streamline managing their requirements in a GitLab Markdown-enabled description field for each requirement.
