      description: |
        Engineering best practices encourage you to include a concise title and description along with any changes you make to a file. The context provided is valuable during the review process and for documenting the justification or motivation for the change.

        The Static Site Editor abstracts as much of the Git workflow away from the editor as possible. One way it does this is by using a default branch name, merge request title, and description. This makes for a simple, one-click submission but the resulting merge request lacks that critical context.

        In GitLab 13.5, you can now include an optional—though strongly encouraged—title and description with your changes that will populate a more descriptive and useful merge request.
