    description: |
      If you're a release manager working across multiple projects in GitLab, you often use Group Milestones to collect related items for a scheduled a release. You may have realized that GitLab Releases can be associated with a Project Milestone, but now you can associate a Group Milestone with a Project Release via the Releases API. As a release manager, this helps you and your teams work more efficiently when coordinating releases with milestones.
