    description: |
      Docker supports immutable image identifiers and we have adopted this best practice to update our cloud-deploy images. When a new image is tagged, we also programmatically retrieve the image digest upon its build, and create a release note to effectively communicate this digest to users. This guarantees that every instance of the service runs exactly the same code. You can roll back to an earlier version of the image, even if that version wasn't tagged (or is no longer tagged). This can even prevent race conditions if a new image is pushed while a deploy is in progress.
