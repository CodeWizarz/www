        To help organizations using SAML SSO with finer grained access control, group owners can assign users a minimal access role. Users with minimal access can list the group in the UI and through the API. However, they cannot see details such as resources, projects or subgroups. This role can be set as the default role at provisioning time for SSO/SCIM or assigned to an existing user in a top level group.
