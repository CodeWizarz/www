      description: |
            Previously in GitLab 13.3, we introduced [multiple value streams per group](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/08/22/gitlab-13-3-released/#create-multiple-custom-value-streams) into Value Stream Analytics. Now, you can delete any custom value streams created in your groups.
