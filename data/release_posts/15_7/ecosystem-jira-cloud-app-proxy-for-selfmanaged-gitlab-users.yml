      For self-managed GitLab, we're excited to announce support for the [GitLab for Jira Cloud app](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1221011/gitlab-com-for-jira-cloud?tab=overview&hosting=cloud)!

      With this release, you can link your self-managed GitLab instance to Jira Cloud and enable the [Jira development panel](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/jira/development_panel.html). This feature supports syncing updates from smart commits, merge requests, branches, builds, deploys, and feature flags back into the Jira development panel. You can pair the GitLab for Jira Cloud app with your [basic Jira integration](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/jira/configure.html).

      For more information, see [Connect the GitLab for Jira Cloud app for self-managed instances](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/jira/connect-app.html#connect-the-gitlabcom-for-jira-cloud-app-for-self-managed-instances).

      If you use Jira Server or Jira Data Center, you should use the [Jira DVCS Connector](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/jira/dvcs.html).
