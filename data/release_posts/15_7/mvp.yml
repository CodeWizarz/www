    Niklas has continually iterated on a manual, painful process for the Technical Writing (TW) team until ultimately making that process simple and automated.

    Niklas worked to refine how to [run batch updates to the CODEOWNERS file](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/technical-writing/-/issues/668) and the related issues. Read the [full story of Niklas's impact](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/issues/14283#note_1214851085).

    Additionally, Niklas is playing a fundamental role in building [GitLab's achievement system](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9429) and has had at least one MR merged every milestone since 14.3!
