    description: |
      As of GitLab 15.7, on-demand DAST API site profiles support configuring GraphQL APIs as the scan target. After selecting API as the site type, you can now select the GraphQL scan method and specify a GraphQL endpoint path. This ability has been available to DAST API scans in a CI/CD pipeline since we introduced the `dast-api.gitlab-ci.yml` template. With the switch from our legacy DAST API analyzer to our new analyzer for on-demand scans, we were able to add this functionality to our on-demand DAST API profiles.
