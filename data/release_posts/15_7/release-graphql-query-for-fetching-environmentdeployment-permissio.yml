    description: |
      We have exposed user permissions for [environments](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/graphql/reference/#environmentpermissions) and [deployments](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/graphql/reference/#deploymentpermissions) through GraphQL. Now you can fetch user permissions for actions, such as update or destroy, for an environment or deployment via API.
