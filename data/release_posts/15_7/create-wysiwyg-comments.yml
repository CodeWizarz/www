      When you collaborate on a wiki page or blog post, you often come across inline HTML comments that are not meant to be rendered. Previously, the Content Editor would ignore these comments to reflect what the actual content would look like. The problem, however, was that making edits in the Content Editor could unexpectedly remove these comments from the file.

      With this release, you can insert new HTML comments inline and edit comments already on the page. These comments appear in a way that indicates they won't be rendered. This feature can help you manage longer wiki pages and is an important step towards editing issue descriptions and comments in future releases.
