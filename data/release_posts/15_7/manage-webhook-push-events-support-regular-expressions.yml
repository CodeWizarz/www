    description: |
      For webhooks triggered on push events, you can now define a [regex pattern](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/webhooks.html#filter-push-events-by-branch) that aligns with your branching strategy. For example, you can use `^(feature|hotfix)/` to allow any push to the `feature` or `hotfix` branch to trigger an event.
