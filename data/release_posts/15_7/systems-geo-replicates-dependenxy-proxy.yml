    description: |
      Geo now replicates the [dependency proxy](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/dependency_proxy/) pull-through cache, which means that a populated cache of images is available at the newly promoted site after a failover. You can now be confident in performing regular failovers and avoid hitting Docker Hub rate limits, thus compromising the operational capabilities of the promoted site. This will help deliver a seamless failover experience to the end users.
