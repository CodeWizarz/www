    description: |
      When you configure your project, you can choose the visibility level and enable/disable project features and their permissions. For example, you could restrict access to `Project members only` for the repository, issues, merge requests, and more. Although you can control several features like this, you can only turn the GitLab Package Registry on and off. You can't set the Package Registry visibility to project members only or everyone with access. This issue has made it difficult for you to create a central registry with approved, vetted packages for distribution throughout your organization. As a workaround, you've had to add everyone to the project, which introduces security risks.

      To help make you more efficient, we've added feature-specific controls for the Package Registry. Now project Administrators and Owners have more flexibility and control over how they share the Package Registry. By default, the Package Registry visibility is set to project members only. For more information about what permissions are required to view, download, or update packages, refer to the [Package Registry visibility permissions](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/package_registry/index.html#package-registry-visibility-permissions) documentation.
