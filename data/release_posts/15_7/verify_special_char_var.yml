    description: |
      Previously, using the `$` character in a CI/CD variable always indicated the start of a reference another variable, which GitLab then tried to expand. As a result, you could not have a value with a `$` as part of the string unless it was [escaped](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/#use-the--character-in-variables), which can be confusing.

      In this release, we are introducing a new setting for project, group, and instance CI/CD variables. You can now toggle whether or not GitLab interprets the CI/CD variable as a raw string, or treats a `$` as the start of another variable that should be expanded.
