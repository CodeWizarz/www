    description: |
      Group owners can now use the API to access the email addresses of any user provisioned by the group. A user is provisioned by the group when their account was created by [SCIM](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/saml_sso/scim_setup.html), or by first sign in with [SAML SSO for GitLab.com groups](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/saml_sso/).
       Previously, group owners could only access this information if a user's email addresses were public.
