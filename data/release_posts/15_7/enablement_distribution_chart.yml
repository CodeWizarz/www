        - Cloud Native GitLab [replaces `alpine-certificates` behaviors with `gitlab-base`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/-/issues/3446) in an upcoming release. To prevent differential behaviors between Alpine and Debian, and increase consistency across containers, we are going to build the pattern on `gitlab-base`. This means operational service containers will share a common root layer, which provides an efficiency boost to Pod instantiation time. The user impact of this, is that we will be changing the image name and tags used. We will maintain a mirrored tag for a short period.
