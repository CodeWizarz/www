      description: |
        The new job execution status badge in **Admin Area > Runners** and the **{group_name} >  CI/CD >  Runners** displays an at-a-glance indicator to determine if there are active jobs on a specific runner in the fleet. This iteration aims to simplify troubleshooting runner queue issues that impact time-to-result for CI builds.
