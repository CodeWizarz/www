    description: |
      Previously, you could [pre-fill CI/CD variables in the "Run pipeline" page](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/index.html#prefill-variables-in-manual-pipelines), with a specific value. Unfortunately, if you had multiple options for the variable's value, you still had to manually input the option you wanted. This was an error-prone process because you could easily input an invalid value, or just mistype it.

      In this release, we've added the ability to set a list of values which are surfaced in a drop-down list in the "Run pipeline" page. Now you can define the exact list of values that are valid for each CI/CD variable when running a pipeline manually, greatly simplifying your workflow when using manually-triggered pipelines.
