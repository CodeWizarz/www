    description: |
      GitLab Code Quality includes an [MR widget](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/testing/code_quality.html#code-quality-widget), a [pipeline report](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/testing/code_quality.html#code-quality-reports), and [MR diff annotations](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/testing/code_quality.html#code-quality-in-diff-view) to help you find and fix problems in your code.
      Many tools, including code scanners and linters for technical documentation, can output results in [Code Quality's open report format](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/testing/code_quality.html#implementing-a-custom-tool).

      Previously, you could only see results from a single scan in the pipeline report and MR diff annotations.
      This made it harder to add custom scanning tools to your pipelines.

      Now, all of the Code Quality views show results from [all report artifacts](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/artifacts_reports.html#artifactsreportscodequality) saved in a pipeline.

      This new feature was [enabled in GitLab.com in GitLab 15.6](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2022/11/22/gitlab-15-6-released/#see-multiple-code-quality-scan-reports-per-pipeline).
      The [feature flag](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/340525) is now also enabled by default for Self-Managed instances in GitLab 15.7 and newer.
