      [Container registry push events are rejected](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/386389) by the `/api/v4/container_registry_event/events` endpoint resulting in Geo secondary sites not being aware of updates to container registry images and subsequently not replicating the updates. Secondary sites may contain out of date container images after a failover as a consequence. This impacts versions 15.6.x and 15.7.0 - 15.7.2. If you're using Geo with container repositories, you are advised to upgrade to GitLab 15.7.3 or 15.8.0 which contain a fix for this issue and avoid potential data loss after a failover.
