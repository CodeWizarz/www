    description: |
      For Geo to function correctly, the clocks between Geo sites must be synchronized. When running [Geo health checks](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/geo/replication/troubleshooting.html#health-check-rake-task), you can now specify a custom NTP server to override `pool.ntp.org`. This change lets you validate your clocks if you are using your own time server, or if you set up Geo in an offline environment and it can't reach the default NTP server.
