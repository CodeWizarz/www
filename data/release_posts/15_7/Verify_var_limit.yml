    description: |
      If your instance has project or group maintainers adding too many CI/CD variables, it could use a lot of resources to process all the variables for each pipeline. To ensure your pipelines continue to run efficiently, we have added a limit of 200 variables per group or project.

      Projects and groups that already have over 200 CI/CD variables can continue to run pipelines as before, but will not be able to add any more variables. We recommend reducing the number of CI/CD variables down to less than 200 per group or project for optimal performance.
