    description: |
      Before this release, there were no controls for changing the size
      of images rendered within Markdown text areas. This often led to unwieldy images
      with no control over how much space they took up in descriptions and comments.
      You can now set the width and height of how images are rendered directly
      in Markdown by appending the `{width=x height=y}` attributes to the image reference. Sizes can be specified with pixels or percentages.
