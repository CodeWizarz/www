        GitLab Static Analysis includes [many security analyzers](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#supported-languages-and-frameworks) that the GitLab Static Analysis team actively manages, maintains, and updates. The following analyzer updates were published during the 15.7 release milestone. These updates bring additional coverage, bug fixes, and improvements.

        - Brakeman-based analyzer updated to version 5.3.1. See [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/brakeman/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v315) for further details.
        - CodeClimate-based analyzer updated to version 0.87.3. We've also disabled a network call that checked for available updates. See [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ci-cd/codequality/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#anchor-0873) for further details.
        - Gitleaks-based analyzer updated to add a detection rule for systemd machine IDs and to exclude `go.mod` and `go.sum` files from scanning. See [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/secrets/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v454) for further details.
        - KICS-based analyzer updated to version 1.6.5. See [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/kics/-/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v374) for further details. This version adds new rules, improves performance, and fixes a bug where some Terraform configurations could cause the analyzer to crash.
        - Kubesec-based analyzer updated to fix a bug for manifests with multiple objects. See [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/kubesec/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v341) for further details.
        - NodeJSScan-based analyzer updated to version 0.3.4. See [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/nodejs-scan/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v340) for further details.
        - Semgrep-based analyzer updated to improve performance of built-in Python rules and support automatic vulnerability resolution. See [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/semgrep/-/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v3100) for further details.
        - Multiple analyzers [updated to include `git`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/347434) so that the analyzer can remove vulnerabilities in files that aren't committed to the repository.
        
        If you [include the GitLab-managed SAST template](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#configure-sast-in-your-cicd-yaml) ([`SAST.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml)), you don't need to do anything to receive these updates. However, if you override or customize your own CI/CD template, you need to update your CI/CD configurations.

        To remain on a specific version of any analyzer, you can [pin to a minor version of an analyzer](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#pinning-to-minor-image-version). Pinning to a previous version prevents you from receiving automatic analyzer updates and requires you to manually bump your analyzer version in your CI/CD template.
