    description: |
      For some projects, the same pipeline can be configured to run differently for different variables or conditions, creating very distinct outcomes for successful pipelines. It can be hard for you to determine which version of that pipeline ran since there is no indication about the inputs used for that particular run. While labels like `scheduled` and `API` help, it is sometimes still difficult to identify specific pipelines.

      Now you can set a pipeline name using the keyword `workflow:name` to better identify the pipeline with string, a CI/CD variable, or a combination of both.
