    description: |
      Before 15.7, quick actions were the only way to add time spent on
      an issue or merge request. While this method works, it's not intuitive for all users.
      To make recording time more efficient, you can now add time entries directly from the sidebar of an issue or a merge request.

      Thanks for the contribution [Marco Zille](https://gitlab.com/zillemarco)!
