    description: |
      When you install the agent, you typically create an agent without a configuration file. However, many features of the agent, including pull-based deployments, require a valid configuration.

      In previous releases, pull-based deployments required you to specify the project where the manifest files are stored. If you had multiple projects, you needed a custom configuration file for each project. Now, you can omit the project ID and the agent will use the manifests in the current project. If your projects use the same conventions to store their manifests, you can use the same configuration file to set up an agent in every project.
