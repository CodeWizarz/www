    description: |
      To align with a popular Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) industry format standard, the Container Scanning tool now outputs a CycloneDX SBOM for the scanned image. This CycloneDX SBOM is named `gl-sbom-report.cdx.json` and is saved in the same directory as the `JSON report file`. You can download CycloneDX SBOMs the same way as other job artifacts.
