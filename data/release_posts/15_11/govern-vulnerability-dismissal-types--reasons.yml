    description: |
      In previous releases, you had to manually add a comment to specify why a vulnerability was dismissed.
      In GitLab 15.11, you can add a reason for dismissing a vulnerability to the Vulnerability Report.
      Now you can quickly and consistently track why vulnerabilities were dismissed.
      
      This feature is only available on GitLab.com. Support for self-managed instances is tracked in [this issue](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4942).
