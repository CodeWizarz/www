    description: |
      We updated the [Value Stream Analytics overview](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/value_stream_analytics/) and replaced the **Total time** line chart with a stacked area chart. The new chart displays a breakdown of all stages, with the time items spent in each stage over a selected time period. This visualization simplifies the top-down optimization flow from the [Value Streams Dashboard](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/analytics/value_streams_dashboard) to Value Stream Analytics, and helps you evaluate the progress of each stage at a glance.
