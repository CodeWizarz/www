    description: |
      Previously, README files were available only at the project level. Now, they're available at the group level too. As a group owner or member, you can use a README to provide more information about your team and invite users to contribute to your projects. In your group overview, selecting the **Add README** action creates a new project (`gitlab-profile`) that contains the `README.md` file. The README is displayed on the group overview page, and can be changed in the group settings.
