    description: |
      The Web IDE Beta allows you to review merge requests and make additional changes to new and modified files without cloning the project to your local machine. However, when launched from a merge request, the Web IDE Beta previously didn't open any of these files.

      To make it easier to contribute, new and modified files now appear in separate tabs when you open the Web IDE Beta from a merge request. Each file is presented with inline diffs so you can review the changes immediately. To optimize performance, the Web IDE Beta only opens the top 10 files (by number of lines changed) in a merge request. In the file tree, any new or modified file is indicated by an icon next to the filename.
