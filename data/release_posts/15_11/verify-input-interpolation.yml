    description: |
      Previously, if you wanted to change the behavior of included CI/CD configuration, like a CI/CD template, you may have used global CI/CD variables.
      However, using global variables applies to the entire pipeline, not just the included configuration, which was not always desirable.

      This release adds the ability to declare mandatory or optional input parameters for each includable configuration file.
      These input parameters replace the need for global variables and are scoped to the included configuration only, having no impact on the rest of the pipeline.
      This allows you to build more robust and isolated CI/CD templates, as well as declare and enforce constraints. Learn how to use CI interpolation in this [example repo](https://gitlab.com/grzesiek/ci-interpolation-example).
