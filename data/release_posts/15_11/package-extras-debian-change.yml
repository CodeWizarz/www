  - title: "Debian package naming enforcement update"
    description: |
      Starting in GitLab 15.11, Debian packages must now have a unique name and version pair at the project level. Previously, name and version uniqueness was enforced at the project distribution level. See [issue 389228](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/389228) for more details. Existing packages with identical name and version pairs are removed on upgrade, keeping the latest package.
