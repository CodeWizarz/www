    description: |
      Previously, if you needed to trigger a rerun of an entire downstream pipeline, you had to rerun the full upstream pipeline. This could be a time-consuming and inefficient process, especially if the upstream pipeline has many jobs or other downstream pipelines.

      In this release, we've added the ability to rerun just the downstream pipeline, without having to re-run the entire parent pipeline, by selecting **Run again** on the trigger job. The newly triggered downstream pipeline replaces the original downstream pipeline in the pipeline graph. This will save you time and resources when you want just the downstream pipeline to run again.
