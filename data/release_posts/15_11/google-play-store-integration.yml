      From GitLab 15.11, you can configure and validate your projects with Google Play Store credentials. You can then use those credentials in CI/CD pipelines to automate releases to the Google Play Store.

      To record your experiences with the Google Play Store integration, see this [feedback issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/incubation-engineering/mobile-devops/feedback/-/issues/13).
