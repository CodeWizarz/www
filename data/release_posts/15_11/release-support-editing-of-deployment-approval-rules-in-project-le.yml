    description: |
      If you follow continuous delivery practices using GitLab approval rules, previously you had to pick between **Multiple approval rules**
      and **Unified approval rules**. Multiple approval rules are generally more flexible, but in past releases were only available through the API.
      [Approval rules settings pages](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/environments/protected_environments.html#protecting-environments) now configure
      multiple approval rules.

      You can [access your previously configure unified approval rule settings](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/environments/deployment_approvals.html#unified-approval-setting)
      through the GitLab API. We are looking into [automatically migrating Unified approval rules to Multiple approval rules](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/357798).
      The migration cannot support all the use cases and might be a breaking change for some users. For this reason, we recommend migrating manually.
