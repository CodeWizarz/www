    description: |
      The Web IDE Beta brings powerful new capabilities and dramatically improved performance to the web-based code editor. The Web IDE Beta has been available for self-managed instances since GitLab 15.7, but was disabled behind a feature flag.

      From GitLab 15.11, the Web IDE Beta is now the default editor for all self-managed instances. You can opt out of the Web IDE Beta any time in your user preferences.
