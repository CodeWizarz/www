        GitLab Static Analysis includes [many security analyzers](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#supported-languages-and-frameworks) that the GitLab Static Analysis team actively manages, maintains, and updates. The following analyzer updates were published during the 15.11 release milestone. These updates bring additional coverage, bug fixes, and improvements.

        - CodeClimate analyzer updated to version 0.94.0. See [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ci-cd/codequality/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#anchor-0940) for further details.

            - Digital Ocean tokens.
        - Security Code Scan-based analyzer updated to add support for .NET 7 by default. See [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/security-code-scan/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v391) for further details.
        - Semgrep-based analyzer updated to version 1.17.1. We also fixed a parsing error related to Go [false positive detection](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#false-positive-detection).

        - Sobelow-based analyzer updated to version 0.12.2. See [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/sobelow/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v3210) for further details.
        
        If you [include the GitLab-managed SAST template](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#configure-sast-in-your-cicd-yaml) ([`SAST.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml)), you don't need to do anything to receive these updates. However, if you override or customize your own CI/CD template, you need to update your CI/CD configurations.

        To remain on a specific version of any analyzer, you can [pin to a minor version of an analyzer](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#pinning-to-minor-image-version). Pinning to a previous version prevents you from receiving automatic analyzer updates and requires you to manually bump your analyzer version in your CI/CD template.

        For previous changes, see [last month's updates](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2023/03/22/gitlab-15-10-released/#static-analysis-analyzer-updates).
