      In GitLab 15.11, we have improved syncing of both existing and new data between Jira Cloud and the GitLab for Jira Cloud app.

      Previously, when you added a namespace to the GitLab for Jira Cloud app, only existing merge request data was synced to Jira. Now, existing branch and commit data is also synced.

      When you viewed a Jira issue, the GitLab for Jira Cloud app previously showed related GitLab branches only if the branch name contained the Jira issue ID (for example, `my-branch-JIRA-1`). The GitLab for Jira Cloud app now also links to GitLab branches when you mention the Jira issue ID in the merge request title or description.
