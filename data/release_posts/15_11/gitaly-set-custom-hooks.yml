      In previous versions of GitLab, administrators needed to directly access the file system that stored a repository to add custom Git server hooks.

      Now, administrators can set Git server hooks for a repository using the new the `hooks set` command in the Gitaly CLI. The Gitaly CLI command targets an individual Gitaly
      node and applies the provided custom Git server hooks to the specified repository. You can use this to programmatically roll out Git server hooks across repositories in Gitaly.

      All existing Git server hooks continue to function. However, `hooks set` is the only way to configure new Git server hooks in GitLab 15.11 and later.

      `hooks set` does not yet work for Gitaly Cluster, but this effort paves the way for us to automatically replicate Git server hooks in Gitaly Cluster. Please follow that
      effort in [issue 5018](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitaly/-/issues/5018).
