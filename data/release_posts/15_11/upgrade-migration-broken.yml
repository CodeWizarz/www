      Migrations to GitLab 15.11 directly from GitLab versions 15.5.0 and earlier on self-managed installs will fail due to a missing migration until the fix for [issue 408304](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/408304) is released in the 15.11.3 [patch release](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/). Affected users wanting to upgrade to 15.11.x can either:

      - Perform an intermediate upgrade to any version between 15.5 and 15.10 before upgrading to 15.11, or
      - Target the forthcoming 15.11.3 patch release.
