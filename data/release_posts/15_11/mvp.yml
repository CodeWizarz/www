    Weyert [added dependency scanning support for pnpm](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gemnasium/-/merge_requests/455)
    (JavaScript package manager). Thanks to Weyert's contributions, multiple customers
    who requested this feature can now identify security vulnerabilities in pnpm lockfiles!

    "Weyert's patience, thoroughness, attention to detail, and motivation were instrumental in completing this challenging piece of work. Weyert quickly responded to code review feedback, provided detailed and clear explanations for implementation decisions, created follow-up documentation merge requests, and even diagnosed and fixed a bug before the feature was made generally available! Well done Weyert for having the persistence and dedication to see this important feature through to completion!" said [Adam Cohen](https://gitlab.com/adamcohen), Sr. Backend Engineer at GitLab.

    Weyert works at Tapico as a lead engineer and maintains the Tapico Marketplace for financial apps. He is excited that Gitlab, through his contribution, now supports pnpm and hopes to start using it at work soon.

    Thank you Weyert! ðŸ™Œ
