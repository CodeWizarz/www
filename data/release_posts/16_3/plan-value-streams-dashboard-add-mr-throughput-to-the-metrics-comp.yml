    description: |
      The [Value Streams Dashboard](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2023/06/12/getting-started-with-value-streams-dashboard/) has been enhanced with new metrics: **Merge request (MR) throughput** and **Total closed issues** (Velocity). In GitLab, **MR throughput** is a count of the number of merge requests merged per month, and **Total closed issues** is the number of flow items closed at a point in time.
      
      With these metrics, you can identify low or high productivity months and the efficiency of [merge request and code review processes](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/analytics/merge_request_analytics.html). You can then gauge whether the [Value Stream delivery](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/value_stream_analytics/) is accelerating or not.
      
      Over time, the metrics accumulate historical data from MRs and issues. Teams can use the data to determine if delivery rates are accelerating or need improvement, and provide more accurate estimates or forecasts for how much work they can deliver.

      To help us improve the Value Streams Dashboard, please share feedback about your experience in this [survey](https://gitlab.fra1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_50guMGNU2HhLeT4).
