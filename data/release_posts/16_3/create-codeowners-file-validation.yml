      You can now see in the UI if your `CODEOWNERS` file has syntax or formatting errors. Being able to specify code owners offers great flexibility, allowing multiple file locations, sections, and rules to be configured by users. With this new syntax validation, errors in your `CODEOWNERS` file will be surfaced in the GitLab UI, making it easy to spot and fix issues. The following errors will be surfaced:
      
      - Entries with spaces.
      - Unparsable sections.
      - Malformed owners.
      - Inaccessible owners.
      - Zero owners.
      - Fewer than 1 required approvals.

      Previously, the `CODEOWNERS` file didn't validate the information being entered into the file. This could lead to creating:

      - Rules for files/paths that don't exist.
      - Rules that create conflict with other existing rules.
      - Rules that don't apply because of incorrect syntax.
