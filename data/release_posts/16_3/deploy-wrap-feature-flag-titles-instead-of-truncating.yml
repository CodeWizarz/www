    description: |
      If you used feature flags in previous versions of GitLab, you might have noticed that long feature flag names were truncated. This made it difficult to quickly differentiate similar feature flag names.

      In GitLab 16.3, the entire feature flag name is shown. Long names wrap across multiple lines, if needed.
