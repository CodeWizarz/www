      You can now see security findings directly in Visual Studio Code (VS Code), just as you would in a merge request.
      
      You could already monitor the status of your CI/CD pipeline, watch CI/CD job logs, and move through your development workflow in the GitLab Workflow panel.
      Now, after you create a merge request for your branch, you can also see a list of new security findings that weren't previously found on the default branch.

      This new feature is part of [GitLab Workflow](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitLab.gitlab-workflow) for VS Code.
      Security scan results are pulled from an API, so this feature is available to developers using GitLab.com or self-managed instances running GitLab 16.1 or higher.
