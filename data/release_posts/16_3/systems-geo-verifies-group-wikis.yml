    description: |
      Geo is now able to detect and correct data corruption of [group wikis](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/wiki/group.html) at rest and in transit. If you use Geo as part of your disaster recovery strategy, this helps to protect you against data loss in the event of a failover.
