      Determining which results from a security or compliance scan are actionable is a significant challenge for security and compliance teams. Granular filters for scan result policies will help you cut through the noise to identify which vulnerabilities or violations require your attention the most. These new filters and filter updates will streamline your workflows:

      - Status: Status rule changes introduce more intuitive enforcement of "new" versus "previously existing" vulnerabilities. A new status field `new_needs_triage` allows you to filter only new vulnerabilities that need to be triaged.
      - Age: Create policies to enforce approvals when a vulnerability is outside of SLA (days, months, or years) based on the detected date.
      - Fix Available: Narrow the focus of your policy to address dependencies that have a fix available.
      - False Positive: Filter out false positives that have been detected by our Vulnerability Extraction Tool, for SAST results, and via Rezilion for our Container Scanning and Dependency Scanning results.
