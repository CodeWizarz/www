        - GitLab 16.3 includes [Mattermost 8.0](https://mattermost.com/blog/mattermost-v8-0-is-now-available/). This version includes
          [security updates](https://mattermost.com/security-updates/) and upgrading from earlier versions is recommended.
        - Our Amazon Linux builds are now [Amazon Linux 2023](https://aws.amazon.com/linux/amazon-linux-2023/). Amazon Linux 2022 was never officially
          generally available and was replaced with Amazon Linux 2023, so we have adjusted our offering to the updated release.
