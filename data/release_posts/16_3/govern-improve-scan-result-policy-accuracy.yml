    description: |
      A scan result policy is a type of security policy you use to evaluate and block merge requests if particular rules are violated. Approvers may review and approve the change, or work with their development teams to address any issues (such as addressing critical security vulnerabilities).

      Previously, we compared vulnerabilities in the latest source and target branches to detect any new violations of policy rules. But, this might not capture vulnerabilities detected from scans running as a result of various pipeline sources. To increase accuracy, we are now comparing the latest completed pipelines for each pipeline source (with the exception of parent/child pipelines). This will ensure a more comprehensive evaluation and reduce the cases where approvals are required when it may be unexpected.
