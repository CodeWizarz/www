    description: |
      Having recently upgraded all of our Linux SaaS runners, we are now introducing `xlarge` and `2xlarge` [SaaS runners on Linux](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/runners/saas/linux_saas_runner.html). Equipped with 16 and 32 vCPUs respectively and fully integrated with GitLab CI/CD, these runners will allow you to build and test your application faster than ever before.

      We are determined to provide the industry's fastest CI/CD build speed and look forward to seeing teams achieve even shorter feedback cycles and ultimately deliver software faster.
