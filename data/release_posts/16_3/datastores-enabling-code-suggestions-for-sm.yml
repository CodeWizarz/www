  - title: "Code suggestions (Beta) for self-managed instances"
    description: |
      GitLab 16.3 will be enforcing cloud licensing as a requirement for Code Suggestions (Beta). Cloud licensing replaces the authentication flow introduced in 16.1. Self-managed customers enabling Code Suggestions in 16.3 no longer need to create a SaaS account. 

      As part of this change, GitLab will be collecting aggregated telemetry data, including the number of unique users and accepted code suggestions to help us scale and improve our service. For more information, see the [Code Suggestions documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/code_suggestions.html).
