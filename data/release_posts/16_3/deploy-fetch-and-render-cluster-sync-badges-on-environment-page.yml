    description: |
      In previous releases, you probably used `kubectl` or another third-party tool to check the status of your Flux deployments. From GitLab 16.3, you can check your deployments with the environments UI.

      Deployments rely on Flux `Kustomization` and `HelmRelease` resources to gather the status of a given environment, which requires a namespace to be configured for the environment. By default, GitLab searches the `Kustomization` and `HelmRelease` resources for the name of the project slug. You can customize the name GitLab looks for in the environment settings.
