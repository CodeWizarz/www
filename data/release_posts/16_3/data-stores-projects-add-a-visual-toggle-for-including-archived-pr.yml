    description: |
      You can now opt to include or exclude archived projects from search results. By default, archived projects are excluded. This feature is available for project search in GitLab. Support for other [global search scopes](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/search/#global-search-scopes) is proposed in future releases.
