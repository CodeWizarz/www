    description: |
      GitLab SAML Group Sync now supports the Azure AD (now known as Entra ID) overage claim, which allows a user to have over 150 groups associated with them. The previous maximum was 150 groups. For more information, see [Microsoft group overages](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/zero-trust/develop/configure-tokens-group-claims-app-roles#group-overages).
