    description: |
      Security bot users will be created to support managing background tasks, and to enforce security policies for all newly created or updated security policy project links. This will ease the process for security and compliance team members to configure and enforce policies, specifically removing the need for security policy project maintainers to also maintain `Developer` access in development projects. Security policy bot users will also make it much clearer for users within an enforced project when pipelines are executed on behalf of a security policy, as this bot user will be the pipeline author.

      When a security policy project is linked to a group or subgroup, a security policy bot will be created in each project in the group or subgroup. When a link is made to a group, subgroup, or an individual project, a security bot user will be created for the given project or for any projects in the group or subgroup. Any groups, subgroups, or projects that already have a link to a security policy project will be unaffected at this time, but users may re-establish any existing links to take advantage of this feature. In GitLab 16.4, we plan to [enable security bots](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/414376) on all projects hosted on GitLab.com that have existing security policy project links.
