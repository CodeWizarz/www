    description: |
      The `needs` keyword is used to define dependency relationships between jobs. You can use the keyword to configure jobs to be dependent on specific earlier jobs instead of following stage ordering. When the dependent jobs complete, the job can start immediately, speeding up your pipeline.

      Previously, it was impossible to use the `needs` keyword to set [parallel matrix](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#parallelmatrix) jobs as dependent, but in this release, we have enabled the ability to use `needs` with parallel matrix jobs too. You can now define a flexible dependency relationship to parallel matrix jobs, which can help speed up your pipeline even more! The earlier your jobs can start, the earlier your pipeline can finish!
