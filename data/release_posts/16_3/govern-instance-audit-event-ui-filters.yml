    description: |
      In GitLab 16.2, we introduced instance-level audit event streaming. However, no filters were available to apply to these streams.

      In GitLab 16.3, you can now apply filters by audit event type to instance-level audit event streams. With the addition of these filters in the UI, you can capture a subset
      of audit events to send to each streaming location, focusing only on the events that are relevant for you.
