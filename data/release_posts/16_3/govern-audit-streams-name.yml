    description: |
      Previously, audit event streaming destinations were assigned by the destination URL. This could lead to confusion when you set up multiple streams for one group or
      instance, because you had to expand the destination in the UI to see what filters and custom headers had been applied.

      With GitLab 16.3, you can now name audit event streaming destinations to help identify and differentiate them when you have multiple streaming destinations defined.
