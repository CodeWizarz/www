      description: |
        Issues are the source of truth for collaboration and what needs to be implemented. Referring back to user stories, designs, and discussions on the issue involves switching between your editor and browser. Merge Requests are the place where feedback on contributions is provided. Referencing this feedback and continuing to make changes requires this same context-switch between browser and editor.

        Reducing the friction of context-switching between tools makes it more efficient to contribute changes to a project. With the [3.6.0 Release](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-vscode-extension/-/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#360-2020-10-26) of [GitLab Workflow](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitLab.gitlab-workflow), issues and merge requests are available directly in VS Code for easy access and collaboration. You can find issues and merge requests assigned to you or created by you and open those directly inside VS Code. This gives quick access to the information needed and the ability to respond directly to issues and merge requests via comments.

        This is the first step in enabling more complete [Merge Request reviews in VS Code](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4607).
