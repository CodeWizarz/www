    description: |
      We recently added support for AWS ECS so you can use it as a deployment target for Auto DevOps. However, review apps for ECS targets weren't automatically stopped. To rectify this, the `Deploy_ECS` template has been extended to automatically stop review apps as part of the Auto DevOps flow so that resources don't go to waste. This ensures a similar experience for Auto DevOps users deploying to ECS and those using Kubernetes, where things work automatically without the need to manually stop and keep track of review apps.
