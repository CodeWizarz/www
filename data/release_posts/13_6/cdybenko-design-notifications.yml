      description: |
        Up until now, notifications on designs were fairly inconsistent with other GitLab notifications, because you did not receive an email unless you were @mentioned. This made it very difficult to keep track of design discussions.

        In 13.6, weâ€™ve added consistent notifications so if you have participated in any way on a design (left a comment, replied, or were @mentioned), you will receive an email for each new comment.
