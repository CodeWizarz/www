        In every release, we continue to make great strides improving GitLab's performance. We're committed to making every GitLab instance faster. This includes GitLab.com, an instance with over 1 million registered users!

        In GitLab 13.6 we're shipping performance improvements for issues, projects, milestones, and much more! Some improvements in GitLab 13.6 are:
