      description: |
        Docker Hub recently began to enforce [rate limits on pull requests from Docker Hub](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/download-rate-limit). Pull rates are now limited based on your individual IP address for anonymous users or on your pricing tier if you are authenticated and signed in.

        The Dependency Proxy can help reduce the amount of pull requests you make from Docker Hub by caching images previously pulled through the proxy. So, we are moving the feature to Core to help address these new limits. By supporting proxying and caching in Core, you can now enjoy increased reliability and performance of your pipelines.
