    description: |
      As part of our ongoing efforts to improve using timeboxes to plan and track work in GitLab, you can now filter issue lists and boards by iteration. For example, a team using iterations for two-week sprints can now use a scoped issue list or board as a single source of truth on objectives in a specific sprint.
