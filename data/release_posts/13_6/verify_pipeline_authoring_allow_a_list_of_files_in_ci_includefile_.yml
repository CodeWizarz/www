    description: 
        Previously, when adding multiple files to your CI/CD configuration using the `include:file` syntax, you had to specify the project and ref for each file. In this release, you now have the ability to specify the project, ref, and provide a list of files all at once. This prevents you from having to repeat yourself and makes your pipeline configuration less verbose.
