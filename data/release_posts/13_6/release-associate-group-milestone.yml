        In GitLab 13.0, you could [associate a release to a milestone](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/releases/#associate-milestones-with-a-release) via a picker in the Gitlab UI. However, users leveraging [group milestones](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/milestones/#project-milestones-and-group-milestones) were unable to associate a release to that milestone. Now, you have the ability to easily connect your group milestone plans with releases.
