      description: |
        If you use CI/CD pipelines with tags or branches and want to know the latest pipeline status, you previously had to navigate away from the branch list or tag list to get to the pipeline page. Now, pipeline status icons are displayed for each branch or tag in their respective list views so you can quickly get to this information for many tags or branches in less clicks.
