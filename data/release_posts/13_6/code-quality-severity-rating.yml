      description: |
        The Code Quality feature in GitLab is great at showing what quality violations exist in a project or are changing in the Merge Request. However, understanding which of those violations is the most important is not clear in the GitLab interface today.

        With the Full Code Quality Report and Merge Request Widget, now you can see the severity rating. This makes it easy for you to understand which code quality violations are most important to resolve before merging and reduces the technical debt in your project.
