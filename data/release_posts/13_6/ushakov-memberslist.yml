      description: |
        Our group members list has been redesigned using the [Pajamas Design System](https://design.gitlab.com/). The new experience includes more descriptive terminology, a new layout, headers for all columns, tooltips for key data elements, and more! The new experience helps group administrators quickly identify key attributes about their group members for more effective group management.
