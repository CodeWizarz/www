      description: |
        When managing a large number of in-flight issues, it can be difficult to track their health status, especially if you are working across multiple epics.
        You can now see an issue's health status in the issue list UI, enabling you to get a quick view of the current status of your work. We're excited to [add filtering](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/218711) in a future iteration.
