      description: |
        You can now filter merge requests by environment and deployment times (in addition to the existing ability to filter by deployment ID). This means you can now find merge requests that match an environment name, deployment ID, or that are deployed before or after a given time. Using these filters in combination can help you determine what's been deployed to an environment over a specified timeframe.
