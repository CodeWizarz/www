      description: |
        Alerts are critical to make developers and operators aware of the health and performance interruption to their service. Previously, you could only create alerts for metrics in GitLab's out-of-the-box dashboards. Starting in this version of GitLab, you can configure alerts on any metric in any custom dashboards that your team creates.
