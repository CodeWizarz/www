    description: |
      A milestone or iteration burndown chart helps track completion progress of total scope, but it doesn't provide insight into how the scope changed during the course of the timebox. Neither has it previously retained historical accuracy regarding how much of the initial committed scope of the milestone or iteration was actually completed.

      To solve these problems and help teams have better insights into scope creep, milestones and iterations now show a burnup chart that tracks the daily total count and weight of issues added to and completed within a given timebox.

      We also refactored burndown charts to use immutable [resource state events](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/resource_state_events.html#issues) that ensure that milestone and iteration charts remain historically accurate[1] even after you've moved issues to another timebox.

      [1] Only applies to milestones and iterations created in GitLab 13.6 or later. Milestones created prior to 13.6 will still have access to [legacy burndown charts](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/milestones/burndown_and_burnup_charts.html#fixed-burndown-charts).
