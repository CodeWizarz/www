     Git Large File Storage (LFS) is one of Git's solutions to handle large files; it replaces large files with text pointers while storing the file contents on a remote server (like GitLab). It allows developers to version very large files with Git and keep Git operations between a local host and a server speedy and performant.
     
     Downloading the source archive of a project that contains LFS files from GitLab used to export a pointer to the file instead of the file itself. This made the archives smaller, but the archive would not hold a complete snapshot of the repository. Having an incomplete repository generally meant more manual work to add those LFS files individually to have an accurate export of the repository. 

      GitLab 13.6 will now export the LFS files instead of the pointer to the files, making it seamless to export the contents of your repository.
