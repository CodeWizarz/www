      description: |
        Right now, all designs are scoped to issues and have a URL that includes the Issue ID and the design filename. This has a lot of limitations for the architecture of Design Management because you cannot refer to a design IID (internal identifier) field. 

        While this feature is very technical in nature, it sets the stage to use designs in more places in GitLab. With unique IIDs, we can then associate designs to [MRs](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3035), [Epics](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2565) and the [Project Level](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3033).
