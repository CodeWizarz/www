  description: |
    Elasticsearch 6.7 will no longer be compatible with GitLab 13.9 and higher. 

    All customers using Advanced Search should plan to upgrade to Elasticsearch 6.8 or greater before upgrading to GitLab 13.9.  If you are currently running a GitLab version older than 13.2, refer to the [version requirements](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/elasticsearch.html#version-requirements) for GitLab and Elasticsearch versions.
