        For websites created using a static site generator, the Static Site Editor can be used to quickly edit page content in a familiar and intuitive interface. Once your edits are complete, you can even create a merge request directly from the editor. In GitLab 13.5, we added the ability to set the merge request [title and description](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/216861), but merge request description templates were not available. This meant merge requests created from the Static Site Editor would have inconsistent descriptions, and be missing any useful information from templates, like checklists.

        In GitLab 13.6, merge requests created from the Static Site Editor will use the default merge request description template if one has been configured. Additionally, you can select from and apply any other description templates defined in `.gitlab/merge_request_templates`, ensuring consistent messaging for reviewers and making it less likely that you'll have to navigate to the merge request page to update the description after submission.
