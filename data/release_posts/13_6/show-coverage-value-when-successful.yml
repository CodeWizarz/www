        As project maintainers, you can use badges to show the current test coverage of your project. Unfortunately, if a pipeline takes a long time, has manual steps, or fails for the branch mapped to the badge, the coverage will show up as `unknown`. This makes badges less useful for you.

        With the coverage badge, your pipeline does not have to be completely successful to display a value, making it easier to see at a glance the status. You can be confident of the test coverage value for your project, for example before a manual release step, without having to dig into the jobs list.
