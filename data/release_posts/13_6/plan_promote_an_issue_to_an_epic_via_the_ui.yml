    description: |
      Promoting an issue to an epic previously relied on the `/promote` [quick action](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/quick_actions.html) in an issue description or a comment, adding some friction to a common and important action.
      To make this action more discoverable, we've introduced a new secondary actions menu in the issue header and added a button to quickly promote an issue to an epic with a single click.
