    description: |
      As a developer, you can use GitLab's webhook features for various events, such as MR events, pipeline events, job events, and deployment events. In this release, you can now use webhook events when a feature flag is toggled either on or off. This addition streamlines the process to update your CI/CD pipelines, receive Slack notifications for events, and more. A huge thanks to [Sashi](https://gitlab.com/ksashikumar) for a great community contribution!
