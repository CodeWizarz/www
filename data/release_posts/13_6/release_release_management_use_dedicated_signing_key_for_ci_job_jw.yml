      Your security is of the utmost importance to us here at GitLab. Ensuring that the features you rely on are kept up-to-date not only provides the latest and greatest in terms of functionality, but keeps you safe, secure, and protects your sensitive data. To improve overall security, you can now use a dedicated signing key for your HashiCorp Vault JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication method and rest assured knowing that the JWT cannot be used to impersonate another user through OpenID Connect.
