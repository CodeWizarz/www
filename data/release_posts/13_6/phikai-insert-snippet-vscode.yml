        Project snippets are a place to share code fragments among your team. These snippets often contain fragments of code that are re-used in multiple places or help to bootstrap similar pages and components.

        When contributing to a project, it can be important to find these snippets and insert their contents in to your working file. Finding these requires context switching out of your editor and then copy/pasting the correct information.

        Using the VS Code extension [GitLab Workflow v3.5.0](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitLab.gitlab-workflow), you can now insert snippets in to your working file, both single and [multi-file](/releases/2020/10/22/gitlab-13-5-released/#snippets-with-multiple-files) snippets are supported.
