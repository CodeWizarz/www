      description: |
        Code Quality reports provide you with a variety of information about code quality violations found on the current branch, but they are not in an easily readable format.

        Now, this report is available as an `.html` file so you can more easily see the code quality violations in your project and determine the impact. You can even host the file on GitLab Pages for even easier reviewing!

        Thanks for the contribution [Vicken Simonian](https://gitlab.com/vicken.papaya)!
