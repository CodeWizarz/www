      description: |
        GitLab 13.6 introduces the ability to [upload image assets directly to your project from the Static Site Editor](#upload-images-in-the-static-site-editor). Images uploaded from your computer are included in the resulting merge request and the default destination for uploaded assets is the `source/images` directory. Depending on the structure of your project, however, this might not be where you want to store your images. It may not even exist.

        The configuration file `.gitlab/static-site-editor.yml` allows you to customize the behavior of the editor. Setting the entry `image_upload_path` to the absolute path to your asset directory will let the Static Site Editor know where you want images to be stored in your project.
