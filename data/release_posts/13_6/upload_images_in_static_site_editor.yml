      description: |
        GitLab 13.1 added support for linking to and previewing images in the Static Site Editor, which is great as long as your images are already hosted somewhere on the web. However, adding new images to your site still required using alternate methods to upload the assets to the project repository.

        In GitLab 13.6, you can not only link to an image, but also upload an image directly to your project from the Static Site Editor and preview it alongside your edits immediately. Clicking the **Add Image** icon in the formatting bar reveals the new option to choose a file from your computer. Once uploaded, the image is displayed in the WYSIWYG mode of the editor, and upon submitting the changes, the file itself is included in the merge request.
