      description: |
        Oftentimes, when viewing an issue board, it can be difficult to identify work that is associated with a specific stream of work.
        To provide more clarity and help you organize work across your teams, we are releasing our first issue board swimlane option, epics!
        Quickly group your work in a horizontal lane across your issue board columns, allowing you to easily see all work related to an epic, and what state it is in!

        Please [share any feedback with us](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/328) on epic swimlanes by leaving a comment!
