    description: |
      When creating a new Git repository, the first branch created is named `master` by default. In coordination with the Git project, broader community, and other Git vendors, GitLab has been listening to the development communityâ€™s feedback on determining a more descriptive and inclusive name for the default branch, and is now offering users options to change the name of the default branch name for their repositories.

      Previously, we shipped the ability to [customize the initial branch name at the instance-level](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/221013) and as part of 13.6, GitLab now allows group administrators to configure the default branch name for new repositories created through the GitLab interface.
