        In 13.4, we released the first iteration of [Code Coverage data for Groups](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/09/22/gitlab-13-4-released/#code-coverage-data-for-all-projects-in-a-group) that enables you to compare the coverage of multiple projects and download the data in a single file from a single screen. However, to analyze the data, you had to open the file to check it manually, and probably imported it into a spreadsheet for further analysis.
        In GitLab 13.6, you can now select specific projects in a group to see their latest coverage values directly in GitLab itself without needing to download a file or waste development time accessing code coverage data. We welcome feedback on the functionality and possible iterations for this feature in our [feedback issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/231515).
