    description: |
      We are building deeper integration with Opsgenie and other alerting tools via [HTTP endpoint](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/operations/incident_management/alert_integrations.html#generic-http-endpoint) integrations so that you can see alerts within the GitLab interface. As a result, the previous link to Opsgenie in the alerts list will be deprecated following the 13.8 release on January 22, 2021.
