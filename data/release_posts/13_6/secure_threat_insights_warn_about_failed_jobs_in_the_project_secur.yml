    description: |
      Project Security Dashboards provide security and engineering teams with a centralized place to manage vulnerabilities. Because the reports are based on the latest successful pipeline scan of the default branch, it is important to know if the results are up to date. Previously, there was no way to determine the time or status of the latest default pipeline scan from these pages. This required navigating away to the Pipelines list and digging for the relevant information.

      You can now see at the top of a Project Security Dashboard when the last default pipeline completed. A link to the corresponding pipeline page is conveniently provided. And in the case of any pipeline failures, you will see the number of failures clearly indicated. The failure notification takes you directly to the **Failed jobs** tab of the pipeline page. After addressing the failure conditions, running a new pipeline will update the vulnerability data for the project along with the new pipeline status area on the Security Dashboard.
