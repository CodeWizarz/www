    description: |
      With this release, when you [create an issue](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/create_issues.html), you can set the issue type to an incident on creation with the `/promote_to_incident` quick action.

      Create an issue template and include this quick action in the description, and you will no longer have to manually select the issue type from the dropdown.
