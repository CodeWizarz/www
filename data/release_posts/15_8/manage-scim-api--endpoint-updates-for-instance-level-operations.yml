    description: |
      Self-managed GitLab now supports the open standard System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM), which allows you to automatically:

        - Create users.
        - Remove users by deactivating their SCIM identities.

      Previously, this was only available for GitLab.com. SCIM enables GitLab administrators to completely automate their user lifecycle management.
