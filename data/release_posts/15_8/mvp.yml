    Patrick is a consistent contributor to [GitLab Terraform Provider](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/terraform-provider-gitlab) - contributing 2-3 releases every milestone. He not only contributes code, but also triages and reviews issues in the provider and contributes to dependencies. He also helps out in the GitLab community: with [community hours](https://www.meetup.com/gitlab-virtual-meetups/events/290284424/), and also in [Discord](https://discord.gg/gitlab).

    We are so appreciative of all that Patrick does, both in our codebase and for our wider community. There is no doubt that much of the [success of the Terraform Provider](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/configure/general/-/issues/302) can be attributed to him. Thank you, Patrick!
