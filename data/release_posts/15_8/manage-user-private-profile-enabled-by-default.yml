    description: |
      Newly created user profiles can now be made private by default. This instance-wide setting helps to comply with local data privacy laws and individual company agreements, for example with a works council. Users can still change the visibility of their profile page from the profile settings, and GitLab administrators can override this setting to make new profiles public.
