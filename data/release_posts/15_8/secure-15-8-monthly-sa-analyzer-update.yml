        GitLab Static Analysis includes [many security analyzers](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#supported-languages-and-frameworks) that the GitLab Static Analysis team actively manages, maintains, and updates. The following analyzer updates were published during the 15.8 release milestone. These updates bring additional coverage, bug fixes, and improvements.

        - CodeClimate-based analyzer updated to version 0.89.0. See [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ci-cd/codequality/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#anchor-0890) for further details.
            - This version also adds support for setting `DOCKER_CONFIG` as an alternative to `CI_REGISTRY_USERNAME` and `CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD` variables, thanks to a community contribution from [`@bitcasso`](https://gitlab.com/bitcasso).
        - KICS-based analyzer updated to version 1.6.6. See [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/kics/-/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v375) for further details. This version improves existing rules.
        - Kubesec-based analyzer updated to automatically fetch Helm dependencies in Helm projects. See [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/kubesec/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v342) for further details.
        - NodeJSScan-based analyzer updated to improve error logging. See [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/nodejs-scan/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v342) for further details.
        - Semgrep-based analyzer updated to version 1.3.0. See [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/semgrep/-/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v3111) for further details.
        - SpotBugs-based analyzer updated to fix an error where invalid line numbers could prevent vulnerabilities from being reported. See [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/spotbugs/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v332) for further details.
        
        If you [include the GitLab-managed SAST template](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#configure-sast-in-your-cicd-yaml) ([`SAST.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml)), you don't need to do anything to receive these updates. However, if you override or customize your own CI/CD template, you need to update your CI/CD configurations.

        To remain on a specific version of any analyzer, you can [pin to a minor version of an analyzer](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#pinning-to-minor-image-version). Pinning to a previous version prevents you from receiving automatic analyzer updates and requires you to manually bump your analyzer version in your CI/CD template.

        For previous changes, see [last month's updates](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2022/12/22/gitlab-15-7-released/#static-analysis-analyzer-updates).
