    description: |
      When importing projects from GitHub to GitLab, the GitLab [**Allowed to push** branch protection rule](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/protected_branches.html#configure-a-protected-branch) is set if the following conditions are met in the GitHub project:

      - The **Require a pull request before merging** setting is set.
      - The **Allow specified actors to bypass required pull requests** setting lists some users.

      If the group you are importing your project to:

      - Has at least a Premium license, GitLab users populate the list of users that are allowed to push.
      - Doesn't have at least a Premium license, the list of users that are allowed to push is limited to roles.
