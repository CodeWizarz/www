    description: |
      In this release, we've added a **Syntax options** link to the search page to help you with complex queries. The drawer content provides syntax options for [Advanced Search](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/search/advanced_search.html) and serves as a quick reference for you when typing a query.
