        Weâ€™re also releasing GitLab Runner 15.8 today! GitLab Runner is the lightweight, highly-scalable agent that runs your CI/CD jobs and sends the results back to a GitLab instance. GitLab Runner works in conjunction with GitLab CI/CD, the open-source continuous integration service included with GitLab.
        
        #### Bug Fixes:

        - [CI_JOB_STATUS always shows running when FF_USE_LEGACY_KUBERNETES_EXECUTION_STRATEGY is set to false](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/issues/27693)
        - [Jobs timeout seeking artifacts](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/issues/29281)
        
        The list of all changes is in the GitLab Runner [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/blob/15-8-stable/CHANGELOG.md).
