    description: |
      As part of group migration by direct transfer with project migration (in Beta), we have added a
      [new application setting](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/settings/visibility_and_access_controls.html#enable-migration-of-groups-and-projects-by-direct-transfer) so that
      GitLab self-managed administrators can more easily enable this feature. Previously, administrators had to use feature flags to enable this feature.

      This new setting must be enabled on both the source and target instances. Remember to also enable the `bulk_import_projects` feature flag if you
      want to migrate projects with your groups.
