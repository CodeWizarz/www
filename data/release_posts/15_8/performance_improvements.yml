      In every release, we continue to make great strides improving GitLab's performance. We're committed to making every GitLab instance faster. This includes GitLab.com, an instance with over 1 million registered users!

      In GitLab 15.8, we're shipping performance improvements for issues, projects, milestones, and much more! Some improvements in GitLab 15.8 are:

      - [Fallback to alternative estimation method when measuring namespace usage](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/container-registry/-/issues/853).
      - [NuGet metadata endpoint triggering too many SQL queries](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/386051).
      - [Extend the use of `security_findings`](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8341).
