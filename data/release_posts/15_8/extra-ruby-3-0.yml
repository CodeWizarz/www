    - title: "GitLab is upgrading to Ruby 3.0 in GitLab 15.10"
      description: |
        Administrators [installing from source](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/install/installation.html) will need to have Ruby 3.0 as a minimum version when upgrading to 15.10+. Otherwise, there is no action required by users at this time. This change is necessary as Ruby 2.7 will reach its end-of-life (EOL) and will no longer receive official updates or support. GitLab will continue our policy of [backporting security fixes to the previous two monthly releases in addition to the current stable release](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/policy/maintenance.html).
