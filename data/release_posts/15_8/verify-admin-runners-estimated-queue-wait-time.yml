      description: |
        A key input in GitLab Runner fleet optimization is having deep insights into queue performance over time. While today there are historical queue duration metrics available for each job on a runner in the Admin Area view, there is no simple mechanism to determine the current queue performance for runners.

        With the new estimated queue time feature, you are now able to, at a glance, determine the median estimated wait time for all instance runners. This data will enable you to proactively identify potential CI job execution issues for your organization's developers and provide insights to inform decisions on configuration or resource changes to optimize your runner fleet.
