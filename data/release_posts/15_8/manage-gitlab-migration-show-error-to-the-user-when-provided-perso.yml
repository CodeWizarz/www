    description: |
      Previously, GitLab validated personal access tokens only after migrations had started. This meant group migrations by direct transfer
      could fail mid-migration because the personal access token didn't have sufficient scope or was no longer valid.

      Now we perform an early check and return an informative error when the scope is not sufficient or the token has expired. This avoids starting
      migrations that will definitely fail.
