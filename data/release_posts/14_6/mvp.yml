    Kev has worked over the 14.6 milestones to find and fix over a dozen [User Experience](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/merge_requests?scope=all&state=merged&author_username=kevslashnull&milestone_title=14.6&label_name[]=UX) issues around the platform. While many contributions were in the Verify stage of the platform, they also added contributions to the [Geo](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/75870), [Release](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/75928), and [Create](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-vscode-extension/-/merge_requests/416) stages.

    They have been contributing to the GitLab platform for quite some time with over 240 merged MRs since the 13.1 release. Thank you Kev! ðŸ™Œ
