      description: |
        Administrators can now set a maximum number of days that an SSH key can remain valid. This is especially useful for organizations that
        are required to enforce SSH key expiration after a given interval for compliance reasons. GitLab
        [already had the ability](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/settings/account_and_limit_settings.html#limit-the-lifetime-of-personal-access-tokens)    
        to set a maximum number of days that Personal Access Tokens (PATs) can remain valid and this feature works in a similar way.

        To set this new limit, administrators can navigate to the Admin Area and select **Settings > General**. Find the new setting by expanding
        **Account and limit** to set **Maximum allowed lifetime for SSH keys (in days)**.
