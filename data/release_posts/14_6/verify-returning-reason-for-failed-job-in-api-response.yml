    description: |
      It can be hard to use the API to gather data about why a job failed. For example, you might want exact failure reasons to make better use of the [`retry:when`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#retrywhen) keyword.

      Now, the `failure_reason` is exposed in responses from the Jobs API, and it is much easier to gather job failure data. Thanks to [@albert.vacacintora](https://gitlab.com/albertvaka) for this contribution!
