    description: |
      Thanks to community contributor Ankur Sethi and their patience, Dependency Scanning now supports proxy settings in Retire.js by respecting the `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variable. If `HTTPS_PROXY` is set, it will be passed to the `retire` command line as a CLI option. Thank you!
