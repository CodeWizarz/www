    description: |
      You can now use [deploy tokens](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/deploy_tokens/index.html) to authenticate users who interact with the Composer repository. Previously, [personal access tokens](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html) and job tokens were used to authenticate users that published and downloaded composer dependencies from the GitLab Composer repository. These tokens are tied to a specific user. [Deploy tokens](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/deploy_tokens/index.html) provide an authentication method that isn't tied to specific users, ensuring that your production workflows are even more efficient and secure.
