    description: |
      You use the GitLab Conan repository to publish and share your C/C++ packages. When creating a Conan package, there are four fields to consider: `name`, `version`, `user`, and `channel`. These fields uniquely identify a package. The `user` and `channel` fields are optional in [Conan 2.0](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/conan_v2.html), but GitLab required you to continue using them. Customizing your naming conventions to match the requirements in GitLab instead of the standards set by Conan is inefficient and impractical.

      We've updated the GitLab Conan repository to align with Conan. Now you can publish and download your Conan packages with or without the `user` and `channel` fields. This improvement helps you to be more efficient and makes it easier to find and validate packages in the user interface. This change is the first step in a broader set of [planned improvements](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6816) to the Conan repository to help move the feature from Beta to GA.
