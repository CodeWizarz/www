    description: |
      In this release we've added the ability for you to transfer a group to a new parent group with the Groups API. Previously, this was only possible through the UI. 

      You can now use the Groups API to move subgroups to a different parent group and make a subgroup into a top-level group. 

      This new functionality is available to administrators and users with:

      - Owner role for the group to transfer.
      - Permission to create a subgroup in the new parent group if transferring a group.
      - Permission to create a top-level group if turning a subgroup into a top-level group.
