    description: |
      As projects continue to be deployed, the number of deployments can increase substantially. To maintain high performance for Git commands, we have added automated deleting of [Git references](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Git-References) for old [deployments](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/environments/#check-out-deployments-locally). GitLab will keep the recent 50,000 deployments per project and automatically delete the Git references for the others.
