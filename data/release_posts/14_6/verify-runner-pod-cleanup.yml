      description: |
        If you have leftover Kubernetes Runner pods, you can now use [GitLab Runner Pod Cleanup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ci-cd/gitlab-runner-pod-cleanup) to clean them up. This open-source utility is installed in the Kubernetes cluster alongside the GitLab Runner Manager, and when configured, deletes orphaned runner pods in the cluster. This new utility reduces maintenance overhead when using the Kubernetes executor for GitLab Runner to execute your CI/CD jobs at scale.
