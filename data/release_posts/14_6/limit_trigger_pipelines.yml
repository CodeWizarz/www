  description: |
    A large amount of triggered pipelines in a single project impacts the performance of GitLab.com. In GitLab 14.6, we are limiting the number of triggered pipelines in a single project on GitLab.com at any given moment to 25,000. This change applies to projects in the free tier only, Premium and Ultimate are not affected by this change.
