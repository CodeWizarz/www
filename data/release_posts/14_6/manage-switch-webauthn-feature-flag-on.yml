    description: |
      WebAuthn (supported, but disabled by default, since GitLab 13.4) is now enabled by default. Users can now use Touch
      ID on Apple devices as a second authentication factor, as long as their browser supports it. This also eliminates
      error messages seen in browsers that are deprecating U2F in favor of WebAuthn.
