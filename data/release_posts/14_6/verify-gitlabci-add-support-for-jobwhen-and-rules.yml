    description: |
      Previously, it was impossible to configure a GitLab CI/CD job to have both the [`rules`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#rules) and [`when`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#when) keywords defined at the job level. You had to add the `when` inside every `rules` section, which could cause long or repeated CI/CD configuration.

      In this release we've dropped that limitation and you can now use `when` at the job level along with `rules`. This makes `when` more flexible, and helps create job configurations that are much simpler.
