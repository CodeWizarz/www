        GitLab Static Analysis is comprised of a [set of many security analyzers](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#supported-languages-and-frameworks) that the GitLab Static Analysis team actively manages, maintains, and updates. Below are the analyzer updates released during 14.6. These updates bring additional coverage, bug fixes, and improvements. 

        - Spotbugs updated to v2.28.11 - [MR](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/spotbugs/-/merge_requests/119), [Changelog](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/spotbugs/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v22811) 
          - Updates Log4j library to patched version (v4.5.2). See [blog post for more information](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/12/15/updates-and-actions-to-address-logj-in-gitlab/)
          - Fix custom CA cert support
        - PMD updated to v2.12.10 - [MR](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/pmd-apex/-/merge_requests/75), [Changelog](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/pmd-apex/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v21210) 
          - Proactive removal of Log4j library. See [blog post for more information](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/12/15/updates-and-actions-to-address-logj-in-gitlab/) 
        - Semgrep updated to v0.76.2 - [MR](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/semgrep/-/merge_requests/94), [Changelog](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/semgrep/-/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v2160) 
        - Gosec updated to v2.9.5 - [MR](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gosec/-/merge_requests/137), [Changelog](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/gosec/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v345)

        If you [include the GitLab managed vendored SAST template](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#configure-sast-in-your-cicd-yaml) ([SAST.gitlab-ci.yml](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml)) you do not need to do anything to receive these updates. However, if you override or customize your own CI template, you need to update your CI configurations. To remain on a specific version of any analyzer, you can [pin to a minor version of an analyzer](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#pinning-to-minor-image-version). Pinning to a previous version prevents you from receiving automatic analyzer updates and require you to manually bump your analyzer version in your CI template.
