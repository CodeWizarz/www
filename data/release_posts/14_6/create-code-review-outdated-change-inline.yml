    description: |
      When addressing review feedback in merge requests, you often change lines your reviewers have commented on. In those comment threads, GitLab indicates that new changes were made. However, to understand if those new changes address the feedback, reviewers would have to navigate away from the context of the discussion.

      Now, when viewing threads related to old changes, you can view the new changes directly in the thread. This improved context helps you review faster and more accurately.
