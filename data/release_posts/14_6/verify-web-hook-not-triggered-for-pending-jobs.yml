    description: |
     Previously, using job event webhooks for CI/CD monitoring was challenging because it was difficult to track the number of `pending` jobs that may exist within a project.

      Now the webhook triggers an event when a job state changes to `pending`, so you no longer need to implement workarounds or custom integrations to keep track of all job statuses.
