    description: |
      After investing time and effort in an issue, sometimes participants realize that the problem is actually an incident. Leveraging the quick action `/promote_to_incident`, users can now promote an issue to an incident. All existing context (title, description, labels, assignees, comments, and more) remain a part of the incident when the issue is promoted.
