    description: |
      There are many use cases for which a non-human user might need to authenticate. Previously, depending on the desired scope, users could use personal, project, or group access tokens to meet this need. These tokens were not ideal, due to still being either tied to a human (for personal access tokens), or an unnecessarily privileged role (for group and project access tokens).

      Service accounts are not tied to a human user, and are more granular in scope. Service account creation and management is API-only. Support for a UI option is proposed in [issue 9965](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9965).
