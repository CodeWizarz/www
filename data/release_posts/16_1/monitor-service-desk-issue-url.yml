    description: |
      For Service Desk requesters, it can be helpful to access the Service Desk issue directly rather than interact with the Service Desk request only via email. We are introducing a new placeholder `%{ISSUE_URL}`, that you can use in your email templates (for example, the "thank you" email) to link requesters directly to the Service Desk issue.
