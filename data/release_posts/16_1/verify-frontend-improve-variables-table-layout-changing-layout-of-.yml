    description: |
      CI/CD variables are a key part of all pipelines and can be defined in multiple places, including in the project and group settings. To prepare for making bigger improvements that will help users intuitively navigate between variables at different hierarchy, we are starting out with improving the usability and layout of the variable list.

      In GitLab 16.1, you will see the first iteration of these improvements. We have merged the "Type" and "Options" columns into a new **Attributes** column, which better represents these related attributes. We appreciate your feedback on how we can continue to improve the CI/CD variable experience, you are welcome to comment in our [variables improvement epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/10506).
