    description: |
      Code suggestions (beta) is now available for GitLab self-managed instances. When you use this feature, relevant source code is securely transmitted to GitLab's infrastructure, which returns an AI-generated code suggestion. GitLab does not have any visibility into a self-managed customer's code other than what is sent to generate the Code Suggestion. GitLab does not persist any customer code sent from the user, nor train on customer data. For more information, see our [self-managed Code Suggestions blog post](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2023/06/15/self-managed-support-for-code-suggestions/).

      We will be provisioning access to this initial iteration of GitLab Code Suggestions on a customer-by-customer basis. Please comment on [issue 415393](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/415393/) to request access, tagging your Customer Success Manager for help with enabling Code Suggestions once your instance is ready.
