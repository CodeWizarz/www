    description: |
      When you add a design to an issue, a design Git repository is created or updated, and an LFS object and an upload (for the thumbnails) are created. Geo already verifies LFS objects and uploads, and now it also verifies the design repositories as well. Now that all underlying data of [Design Management](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/design_management.html) is verified, your design data is ensured to not be corrupted in transfer or at rest. If Geo is used as part of a disaster recovery strategy, this protects you against data loss.
