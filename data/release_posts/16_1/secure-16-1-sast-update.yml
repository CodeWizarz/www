      GitLab SAST includes [many security analyzers](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#supported-languages-and-frameworks) that the GitLab Static Analysis team actively maintains, updates, and supports. We published the following updates during the 16.1 release milestone:

      - The Semgrep-based analyzer is updated to use version 1.23.0 of the Semgrep engine. We've also [clarified guidance and improved efficacy](#clearer-guidance-and-better-coverage-for-sast-rules) of the GitLab-managed rules that are used to scan C, C#, Go, and Java. See the [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/semgrep/-/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v434) for further details.
      - The SpotBugs-based analyzer now supports changing the "effort level" by [setting the `SAST_SCANNER_ALLOWED_CLI_OPTS` CI/CD variable](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#security-scanner-configuration). This allows you to improve performance by reducing the scan's precision and its ability to detect vulnerabilities. See the [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/spotbugs/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v420) for further details.

      If you [include the GitLab-managed SAST template](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#configure-sast-in-your-cicd-yaml) ([`SAST.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml)) and run GitLab 16.0 or higher, you automatically receive these updates.
      To remain on a specific version of any analyzer and prevent automatic updates, you can [pin its version](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#pinning-to-minor-image-version).

      For previous changes, see [last month's updates](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2023/05/22/gitlab-16-0-released/#sast-analyzer-updates).
