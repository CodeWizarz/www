    description: |
      Geo adds filtering by replication status to all components managed by the [self-service framework](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/geo/framework.html). Now you can filter items in the replication details views by "In progress", "Failed", and "Synced" status making it easier and faster to locate data that is failing to synchronize.
