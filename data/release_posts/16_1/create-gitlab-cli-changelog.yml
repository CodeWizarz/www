      description: |
        Changelogs generate comprehensive lists of changes based on commits to a project. They can be challenging to automate or view, and require interacting with the GitLab API.

        With the release of [GitLab CLI v1.30.0](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/cli/-/releases/v1.30.0) you can now generate changelogs for projects directly from your shell. The `glab changelog generate` command makes it easier to review, automate, and publish changelogs.

        Thanks [Michael Mead](https://gitlab.com/michael-mead) for your contribution!
