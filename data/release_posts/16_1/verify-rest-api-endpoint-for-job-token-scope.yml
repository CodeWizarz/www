    description: |
      Starting in GitLab 16.0, the [default CI/CD job token (`CI_JOB_TOKEN`) scope changed](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/jobs/ci_job_token.html#configure-cicd-job-token-access) for all new projects. This increased the security of new projects, but added an extra step for users who used automation to create projects. The automation sometimes has to configure the job token scope as well, which could only be done with GraphQL (or manually in the UI), not the REST API.

      To make this setting configurable through the REST API as well, [Gerardo Navarro](https://gitlab.com/gerardo-navarro) added a new endpoint to control the job token scope in 16.1. It is available to users with a Maintainer or higher role in the project. Thank you for this great contribution Gerardo!
