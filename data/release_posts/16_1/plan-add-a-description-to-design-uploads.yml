    description: |
      Currently the [Design uploads](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/design_management.html#add-a-design-to-an-issue) have no metadata to explain their purpose, or why they are being uploaded. We've added a text box as a description so you can help users understand the image better.
