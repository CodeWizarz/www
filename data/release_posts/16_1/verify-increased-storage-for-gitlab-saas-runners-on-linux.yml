    description: |
      After recently upsizing our [GitLab.com SaaS runners on Linux](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/runners/saas/linux_saas_runner.html) in vCPU and RAM, we have now also increased the storage for `medium` and `large` machine types.

      You can now seamlessly build, test, and deploy larger applications that require a secure, on-demand GitLab Runner Linux environment fully integrated with GitLab CI/CD.
