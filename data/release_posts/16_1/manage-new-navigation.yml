      GitLab 16.1 features an all-new navigation experience! We've defaulted this experience to on for all users. To get started, go to your avatar in the top right of the UI and turn on the **New navigation** toggle.

      The new navigation was designed to solve three key areas of feedback: navigating GitLab can be overwhelming, it can be hard to pick up where you left off, and you can't customize the navigation.

      The new navigation includes a streamlined and improved left sidebar, where you can:

      * Pin ðŸ“Œ frequently accessed items.
      * Completely hide the sidebar and "peek" it back into view.
      * Easily switch contexts, search, and view subsets of data with the new **Your Work** and **Explore** options.
      * Scan more quickly because of fewer top-level menu items.

      We are proud of the new navigation and can't wait to see what you think. Review a [list of what's changed](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9044#whats-different) and read our blog posts about the navigation [vision](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2023/05/01/gitlab-product-navigation/) and [design](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2023/05/15/overhauling-the-navigation-is-like-building-a-dream-home/).

      Please try the new navigation and let us know about your experience in [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/409005). We are already [addressing](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/409005#actions-we-are-taking-from-the-feedback) the feedback and will eventually remove the toggle.
