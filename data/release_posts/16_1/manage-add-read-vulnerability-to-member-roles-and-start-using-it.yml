    description: |
      The ability to view the vulnerability report is now split into a separate permission, enabling GitLab administrators and group owners to create a custom role with this permission. Previously, viewing the vulnerability report was limited to the Developer role and above. Now, any user can view the vulnerability report, as long as they are assigned a custom role that has the permission.
