    description: |
      Security and compliance policies allow organizations to enforce checks and balances across multiple projects to align with their security and governance programs. It's critical for our customers to ensure changes that impact policies do not result in the guardrails coming down. With this update, invalid rules will "fail closed", blocking MRs until invalid rules in any scan result policies are addressed.
