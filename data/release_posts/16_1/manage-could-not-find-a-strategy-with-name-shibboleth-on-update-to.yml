    description: |
      Shibboleth OmniAuth support has been re-introduced to GitLab. It was previously [removed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/388959) in GitLab 15.9 due to lack of upstream support. Thanks to a generous community contribution by [lukaskoenen](https://gitlab.com/lukaskoenen), who took on upstream support, `omniauth-shibboleth-redux` is now supported in self-managed GitLab.
