    description: |
      The [needs:](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#needs) keyword defines a dependency relationship between jobs, which you can use to set jobs to run out of stage order. In this release we've added the ability to define this relationship for specific `rules` conditions. When a condition matches a rule, the job's `needs` configuration is completely replaced with the `needs` in the rule. This can help speed up a pipeline based on your defined conditions, when a job can start earlier than normal. You can also use this to force a job to wait for an earlier one to complete before starting, you now have more flexible `needs` options!
