    description: |
      When a GitHub project finished importing, GitLab showed a simple summary of imported entities. However, GitLab didn't show exactly which GitHub
      entities failed to import nor the errors that caused the import failures. This made it difficult to decide if import results were satisfactory or not.

      In this release, we have extended the import summary to include a list of GitHub entities that weren't imported and, if possible, provide
      a direct link to these entities on GitHub. GitLab now also shows an error for each failure. This helps you understand how well the import worked
      and helps you troubleshoot problems.
