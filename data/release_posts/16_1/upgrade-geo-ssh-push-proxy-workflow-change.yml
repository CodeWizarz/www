      Geo has changed the workflow for proxying SSH Git push requests. Push requests made against a secondary site are now proxied via the [GitLab shell](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/gitlab_shell/) (instead of Puma) to the primary site. The change removes the [1.0 GB push size limit](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8819) that prevented large push requests from succeeding. The [push size limit is now 1.86 GB](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/geo/#limitations) which we will aim to remove in a future release. The new call flow through GitLab shell also increases throughput up to 50% in some cases. This is a behind-the-scenes change. No action is needed on your part.
