    description: |
      Domain verification serves multiple purposes across GitLab. Previously, in order to verify a domain, you had to complete the [GitLab Pages](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/) wizard, even if you were verifying a domain for a purpose outside of GitLab Pages.

      Now, domain verification lives at the group level, and has been streamlined. This makes it easier to verify your domains.
