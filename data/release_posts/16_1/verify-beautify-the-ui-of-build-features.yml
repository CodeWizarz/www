    description: |
      One of GitLab's most used features is CI/CD. In 16.1, we focused on improving the usability and experience of CI/CD pipeline and job list views, as well as the pipeline details page. It's now easier to find the information you are looking for! If you have any comments about the changes, we'd love to hear from you in our [feedback issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/414756).
