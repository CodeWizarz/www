    description: |
      GitLab Dedicated is a fully managed, single-tenant SaaS deployment of our comprehensive DevSecOps platform designed to address the needs of customers with stringent compliance requirements.

      Customers in highly-regulated industries are unable to adopt multi-tenant SaaS offerings due to strict compliance requirements like data isolation. With GitLab Dedicated, organizations can access all of the benefits of the DevSecOps platform – including faster releases, better security, and more productive developers – while satisfying compliance requirements such as data residency, isolation, and private networking.
