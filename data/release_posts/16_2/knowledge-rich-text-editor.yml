      GitLab 16.2 features an all-new rich text editing experience! This new capability is available for everyone, as an alternative to the existing Markdown editing experience.
      
      For many, using the plain text editor for comments or descriptions is a barrier to collaboration. Remembering the syntax for image references or working with long tables can be tedious even for those who are relatively experienced with the syntax. The rich text editor aims to break down these barriers by providing a "what you see is what you get" editing experience and an extensible foundation on which we can build custom editing interfaces for things like diagrams, content embeds, media management, and more.

      The rich text editor is now available in all issues, epics and merge requests. We plan to make it available in more places across GitLab soon. You can follow our progress [here](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/10378).

      We are proud of the new editing experience and can't wait to see what you think. Please try the new rich text editor and let us know about your experience in [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/416293).
