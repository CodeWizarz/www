    description: |
      The `agentk` component of the agent for Kubernetes requires a token to authenticate with GitLab. Previously, you could provide the token as-is, or as a reference to the Kubernetes secret that contains the token. However, you might operate in an environment where the secret is already available in a volume, and prefer to mount that volume instead of creating a separate secret. From GitLab 16.2, the GitLab agent Helm chart ships with this added feature thanks to a community contribution from [Thomas Spear](https://gitlab.com/tspearconquest).
