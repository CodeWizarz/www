      You can now define custom CI variables, including their values, in the Scan Execution Policies editor. CI variables defined in a policy override the matching variables defined in the projects enforced by the policy. For example, a policy may define a CI Variable `SAST_EXCLUDED_ANALYZERS` to `brakeman`. When the scanner is enforced in a project, the scanner will run with the variable set to `brakeman` regardless of any variables defined in the project's CI configuration. For each scan type, you can define values for default variables, also create custom key-value pairs for custom CI variables. This makes customizing a scan execution policy quicker and easier.
