    description: |
      When you suggest changes in a merge request, you can now edit your suggestions more quickly. In a comment, switch to the rich text editor and use the UI to move up and down the lines of text. With this change, you can view your suggestions exactly as they will appear when the comment is posted.

      The rich text editor is a new way of editing in GitLab. It's available in merge requests, but also available alongside the plain text editor in issues and epics.

      We plan to have the rich text editor available in more areas of GitLab soon and we are actively working on that. You can follow our progress [here](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/10378).
