    description: |
      By default, Flux synchronizes Kubernetes manifests at regular intervals. Triggering a reconciliation immediately when a manifest changes by default requires additional configuration. With the GitLab agent for Kubernetes, you can push a change to your manifest and trigger a Flux sync automatically.
