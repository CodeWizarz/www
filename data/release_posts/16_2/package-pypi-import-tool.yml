    description: |
      Have you been thinking about moving your PyPI repository to GitLab, but haven't been able to invest the time to migrate? In this release, GitLab is launching the first version of a PyPI package importer.

      You can now use the Packages Importer tool to import packages from any PyPI-compliant registry, like Artifactory.
