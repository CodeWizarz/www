    description: |
      With this release, the GitLab for Slack app is available on self-managed instances. On self-managed GitLab, you can create
      a copy of the GitLab for Slack app from a [manifest file](https://api.slack.com/reference/manifests#creating_apps) and
      install that copy in your Slack workspace. Each copy is private and not publicly distributable.

      To create and configure the app, see [GitLab for Slack app administration](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/settings/slack_app.html).
