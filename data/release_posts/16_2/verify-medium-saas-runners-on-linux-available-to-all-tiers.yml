    description: |
      We have now made our medium [GitLab SaaS runner on Linux](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/runners/saas/linux_saas_runner.html) with 4 vCPUs and 16 GB RAM available to all tiers.

      Previously users on the Free tier were only able to use our small Linux runner, sometimes causing longer CI/CD execution times.
      We are excited to see our Free users accelerate their pipeline speeds.
