    description: |
      In previous versions of GitLab, when a default branch was fully protected, only project maintainers and owners could push an initial commit to a default branch.

      This caused problems for developers who created a new project, but couldn't push an initial commit to it because only the default branch existed.

      With the **Fully protected after initial push** setting, developers can push the initial commit to the default branch of a repository, but cannot push
      any commits to the default branch afterward. Similar to when a branch is fully protected, project maintainers can always push to the default branch but no one
      can force push.
