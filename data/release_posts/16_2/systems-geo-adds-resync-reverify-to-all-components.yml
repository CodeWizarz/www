    description: |
      Geo adds the ability to resync and reverify individual items for all component types managed by the [self-service framework](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/geo/framework.html). Now you can force a resync or reverification operation on any individual item managed by Geo by using the UI. This can help expedite a resync or reverification operation for failed items, or after changes have been applied to fix sync or verification errors.
