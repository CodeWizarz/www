    description: |
      When reviewing a list of dependencies, it is important to have an overall view. 
      Managing dependencies at the project level is problematic for large organizations that want to audit their dependencies across all their projects.
      With this release, you can see all dependencies at the project or group level, including subgroups. This feature is off by default behind feature flag `group_level_dependencies`.
