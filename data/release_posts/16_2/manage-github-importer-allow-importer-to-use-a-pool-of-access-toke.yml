    description: | 
      By default, the GitHub importer uses a single access token when importing projects from GitHub to GitLab. An access token for a user account is typically rate limited to
      5000 requests per hour. This can significantly reduce the speed of the importer when:
        
      - Importing multiple small to medium sized projects.
      - Importing a single massive project with a lot of data.
      
      With this release, you can pass a list of access tokens to the GitHub importer API so that the API can rotate through them when rate limited.
      When using multiple access tokens:

      - The tokens cannot be from the same account because they would all share one rate limit.
      - Tokens must have the same permissions and sufficient privileges to the repositories to import.
