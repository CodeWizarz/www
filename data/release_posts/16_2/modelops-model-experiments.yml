    description: |
      When data scientists create machine learning (ML) models, they often experiment with different parameters, configurations, and feature engineering, so they can improve the performance of the model. The data scientists need to keep track of all of this metadata and the associated artifacts, so they can later replicate the experiment. This work is not trivial, and existing solutions require complex setup.

      With machine learning model experiments, data scientists can log parameters, metrics, and artifacts directly into GitLab, giving easy access to their most performant models. This feature is an [experiment](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/policy/experiment-beta-support.html#experiment).
