    description: |
      We added a new configuration file to the [Value Streams Dashboard](https://youtu.be/EA9Sbks27g4) for easier customization of the dashboard's data and appearance. In this file you can define various settings and parameters, such as title, description, and number of panels and filters. The file is schema-driven and managed with version control systems like Git. This enables tracking and maintaining a history of configuration changes, reverting to previous versions if necessary, and collaborating effectively with team members.

      The new configuration also includes the option to filter the metrics by labels. You can adjust the [metrics comparison panel](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2023/06/12/getting-started-with-value-streams-dashboard/) based on your areas of interest, filter out irrelevant information, and focus on the data that is most relevant to your analysis or decision-making process.
