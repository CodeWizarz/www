    description: |
      Properly storing, rotating, and managing signing keys can be difficult and typically requires the overhead of managing a separate Key Management System (KMS). GitLab now supports keyless signing through a native integration with the Sigstore Cosign tool which allows for easy, convenient, and secure signing within the GitLab CI/CD pipeline.  Signing is done using a very short-lived signing key. The key is generated through a token obtained from the GitLab server using the OIDC identity of the user who ran the pipeline. This token includes unique claims that certify the token was generated by a CI/CD pipeline.

      To begin using keyless signing for your build artifacts, container images, and packages, users only need to add a few lines to their CI/CD file as [shown in our documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/signing_examples.html).
