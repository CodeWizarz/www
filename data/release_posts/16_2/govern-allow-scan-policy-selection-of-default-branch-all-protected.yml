    description: |
      Scan execution and scan result policies will allow you to scope enforcement to branches that are "Default" branches or "Protected branches" across the many projects a policy is enforcing. Rather than requiring policies to specify branch names explicitly, policies can be enforced more broadly and ensure branches with atypical names are not excluded from compliance.

      Branch rules can be configured across our various security policy rule types by using the `branch_type` field:
