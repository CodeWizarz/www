    description: |
      [`include`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/index.html#include) is one of the most popular keywords to use when writing a full CI/CD pipeline. If you are building larger pipelines, you are probably using the `include` keyword to bring external YAML configuration into your pipeline.

      In this release, we are expanding the power of the keyword so you can use `when: never` when using [`rules` with `include`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/includes.html#use-rules-with-include). Now, you can decide when external CI/CD configuration will be excluded when a specific rule is satisfied. This will help you write a standardized pipeline with better ability to dynamically modify itself based on the conditions you choose.
