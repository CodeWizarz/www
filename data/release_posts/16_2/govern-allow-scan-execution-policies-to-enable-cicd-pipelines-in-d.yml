    description: "In previous GitLab versions, security policies were not enforced on projects
      without a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file, or where AutoDevOps was disabled. In GitLab 16.2, security
      policies implicity enable CI/CD pipelines on projects that do not contain a `.gitlab-ci.yml`
      file. This is another step in ensuring compliance of security policies and allow you to
      enforce secret detection, static analysis, or any other jobs where builds are not required."
