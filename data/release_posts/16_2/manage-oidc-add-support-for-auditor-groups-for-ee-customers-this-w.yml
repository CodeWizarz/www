    description: |
      You can now sync OIDC groups to the `auditor` role in GitLab. This allows automated user lifecycle management facilitated by OIDC to use the `auditor` role, which was previously unsupported in the role mapping.

      Thank you [Marin Hannache](https://gitlab.com/mareo) for your contribution!
