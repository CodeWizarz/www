    description: |
      [OpenSSH 8.2](https://www.openssh.com/releasenotes.html#8.2) added support for FIDO/U2F hardware authenticators with new
      ecdsa-sk and ed25519-sk key types.

      GitLab now supports these key types, allowing users to take advantage of hardware-backed SSH authentication.
