    description: |
      Writing a valid GitLab CI/CD pipeline can be difficult regardless of whether you're a novice or more advanced user. Syntax structure should be accurate and even a small typo or misconfiguration could cause your pipeline to be invalid, introducing more work to find the source of the problem. In this release, we've added auto-completion of CI/CD keywords to the pipeline editor, which will greatly increase your efficiency when writing and debugging pipelines. You'll be more confident that your pipeline will run the way you want it the very first time it runs.
