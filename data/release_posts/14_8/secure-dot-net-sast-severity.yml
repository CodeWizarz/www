    description: |
        Previously, GitLab SAST returned an `Unknown` severity for all vulnerabilities identified in .NET projects. Now, .NET results are assigned a severity value based on the [CWE](https://cwe.mitre.org) associated with the finding.

        Severity levels are included in the [`gl-sast-report.json`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#reports-json-format) artifact in all GitLab tiers.

        With GitLab Ultimate, these new severity levels make it easier to secure your .NET projects by [requiring approval for merge requests](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/index.html#vulnerability-check-rule) and [analyzing your overall risk posture](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/vulnerability_report/).

        For backwards compatibility reasons, severities will not appear in results by default until you upgrade to GitLab 15.0.
        To receive .NET SAST results with severity values before then, update your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to [pin to the new major version](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#pinning-to-minor-image-version), v3, of the Security Code Scan analyzer.
        You can add this [code snippet](https://gitlab.com/-/snippets/2223915) to your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to try these new scanning capabilities.
        In GitLab 15.0, we will promote this new version to run by default.
