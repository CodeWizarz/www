    description: |
      Previously, the project CI lint API endpoint for validating CI/CD configuration was only capable of parsing configuration that exists in the default branch. In this release we've added an optional `ref` parameter to the endpoint, so you can now lint the CI/CD configuration you have in other branches or tag refs.
