      description: |
        You can now view the details of a runner in the Admin Area. This new view aims to provide the most valuable information about each runner associated with your GitLab instance. You can view last contact, runner version, and assigned projects, which is now paginated. In the new paginated jobs tab, you can also view a full list of jobs run by the Runner, which helps you view, search, and analyze CI/CD job execution history quickly.
