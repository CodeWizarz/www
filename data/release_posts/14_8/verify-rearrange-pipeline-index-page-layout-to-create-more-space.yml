      GitLab values efficiency, so we want to empower you to easily navigate our platform, especially when viewing jobs and pipelines. You might have noticed that the many options and columns on the job and pipeline index pages make it difficult to understand what GitLab CI/CD information is most relevant to your project.

      Now, we have restructured these views so you can quickly get the pipeline information you need, including status, name of pipeline, merge request ID, and commit SHA.
