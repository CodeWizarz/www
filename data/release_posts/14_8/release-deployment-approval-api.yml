    description: |
      We are excited to introduce deployment approval via API. Prior to this feature, teams had the ability to protect an environment from any changes by requiring a manual job to be executed in a pipeline as a workaround. Now, deployment approval is a first-class concept in our platform. Teams can configure a number of approvers for a specific environment and use a new API endpoint to execute an approval or rejection of a deployment to that environment. This capability enables teams to create workflows to obtain the proper approvals before deploying software to production or other protected environments.
