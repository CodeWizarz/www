    Beginning in 14.5, Piotr worked closely with both product and UX to develop a solution that allowed users the flexibility to create custom templates for their [merge commits](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2021/11/22/gitlab-14-5-released/#merge-commit-message-template). In 14.6, he followed up by introducing the same variable-based templates for [squash commits](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2021/12/22/gitlab-14-6-released/#squash-commit-message-template), dramatically improving the experience for the various preferences teams have for squashing commits.

    In GitLab 14.8, Piotr continued to build upon his improvements to the merge commit and squash commit templates. He's continued his presence as an amazing partner for product, design, technical writing, and the wider GitLab community by shipping a wonderful UX improvement to [show the default value](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/77081) in the template areas. This work further improves users' understanding of the templates' current values, and how they can be modified.
    
    Piotr also contributed docs improvements to our merge request API, and [added a field to our REST API](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/77658) to unify it with GraphQL.

    Thank you, Piotr!
