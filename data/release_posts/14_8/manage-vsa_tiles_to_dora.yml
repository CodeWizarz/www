    description: |
      In this release, we've added the number of deployments and deployment frequency to DORA metrics displayed under CI/CD Analytics:

       - Number of deployments shows the number of successful deployments in the date range
       - Deployment frequency shows the average number of successful deployments. 

      This data previously appeared only in value stream analytics. With this additional information, you can gain a better understanding of your team's deployment frequency for better tracking.
