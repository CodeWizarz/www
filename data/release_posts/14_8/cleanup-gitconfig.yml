    description: |
      Gitaly parses `.gitconfig` files that can grow very large when not maintained. Large `.gitconfig` files can heavily impact the performance of short-running Git commands. GitLab 14.8:

      - Resolves a known issue where we were not correctly cleaning up certain configuration keys as expected.
      - Proactively removes empty configuration sections.

      Combined, these updates improved performance by 50% or more for these short-running Git commands, resulting in a substantial reduction during regular Git operations!
