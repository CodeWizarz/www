    description: |
      In this release, we have introduced additional progress tracking capabilities to roadmaps. You can now view the percentage of completed epics based on issue count instead of issue weight. This functionality is useful for organizations that are using Kanban or other methodologies that don't require their teams to set a weight on issues.

      You can now also customize the level of milestones to include in your roadmap, allowing you to tailor your view to meet the needs of your audience.
