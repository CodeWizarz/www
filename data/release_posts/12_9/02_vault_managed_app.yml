      description: |
        GitLab wants to make it easy for users to have modern secrets management. We are now offering users the ability to install Vault within a Kubernetes cluster as part of the GitLab CI managed application process. This will support the secure management of keys, tokens, and other secrets at the project level in a Helm chart installation.
