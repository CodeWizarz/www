    description: "GitLab Releases are a one stop place for all the contents of a release. With the new Release Progress View introduced in GitLab 12.9, you will be able to easily answer the questions many release and build managers are spending time manually collecting. In a single look on the Release page, you can see the number of open, closed, and in-progress public issues that are associated with the milestones of the Release. A convenient percentage progress bar will also give you a quick update on how your release is progressing."
