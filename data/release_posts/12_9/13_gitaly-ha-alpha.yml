    description: |
      For many customers, GitLab is a business critical application because an
      outage would prevent developers from being productive, and obstruct the
      deployment of new features and fixes. To prevent outages, GitLab can be
      run in a [highly available
      (HA)](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/reference_architectures/index.html)
      configuration. The currently documented HA configuration recommends using
      NFS. However, NFS significantly increases the latency of read and write
      operations, which severely impacts the performance of Git operations,
      particularly as the size of the repository grows.

      Gitaly now offers experimental alpha support for high availability without
      using NFS. **This feature should not be used in production!** There are
      single points of failure, and unexpected data loss may occur. However, you
      may wish to start evaluating high availability for Gitaly in a test
      environment. Since January, we have successfully been testing on
      GitLab.com with a small number of projects.

      High Availability for Gitaly is eventually consistent, implemented as an
      asynchronous replication queue, favoring availability over consistency. If
      an outage occurs on a primary Gitaly node before the replication queue has
      been drained, data loss will occur. In parallel we have begun
      investigating [strong
      consistency](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1189) to prevent
      such data loss scenarios.
