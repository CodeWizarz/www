        It can be difficult to navigate to a changed page in a Review App, especially in a statically generated site. [Review Apps](https://about.gitlab.com/stages-devops-lifecycle/review-apps/) and [Visual Reviews](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/review_apps/index.html#visual-reviews) make it easy to leave comments directly in a Merge Request while looking at the modified page. That is, once you find it.

        Starting in GitLab 12.9, users of Visual Review tools will be able to use a drop down list to navigate directly to the page(s) modified in a Merge Request, making it easier to find the changed page(s) and provide feedback on a Merge Request.
