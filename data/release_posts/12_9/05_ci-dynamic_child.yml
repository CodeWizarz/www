      description: |
        Beginning with this release, child pipelines can now be started using a dynamically
        generated `.gitlab-ci.yml`. Using this approach, you can generate child
        pipelines that reflect runtime analysis of what's changed or other criteria (for example, to
        build a matrix of targets and architectures).

        This addition will open up a whole new set of use cases for this feature,
        while helping keep configuration simple. We can't wait to see what
        you build with it!
