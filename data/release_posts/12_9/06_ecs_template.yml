      description: |
        Many users want to deploy to AWS using GitLab CI/CD. In order to help deploy to Elastic Container Service (ECS), we have created a template that shows you how to get started.

        Users can include the template in their configuration, specify a few variables, and their application will be deployed and ready to go in no time.
