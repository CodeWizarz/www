      description: |
        It is important to track everything that gets delivered to production. We now record when a merge commit is cherry-picked into a branch that gets deployed (when done either through the UI or through the API). The original merge request thread is updated with a system note indicating that the merge commit was cherry-picked into the deployed branch, and it is also included in the list of deployed merge requests.
