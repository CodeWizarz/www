      description: |
        The descriptions of issues, merge requests, and epics can be freely
        edited as they naturally evolve. In the past, changes were not recorded
        and the history of these descriptions was lost. Not any more! GitLab now
        stores these updates, and allows you to view what changes were made,
        who made them, and when!
