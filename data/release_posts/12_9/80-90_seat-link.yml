        Customers with self-managed instances should have a simple and stress-free process for adding and paying for users as they grow. Seat Link is our first step towards providing self-managed customers with more transparent, prorated charges for user growth throughout the year. Seat Link will enable GitLab to automatically charge a prorated amount each quarter for added users.

        So how does it work? Seat Link sends to GitLab daily a count of all users in connected, self-managed instances, so we can automate prorated reconciliations and you never have to deal with true-ups again. Data will be sent securely through an encrypted connection.

        Seat Link will send only the following information needed to automate prorated charges:

        * Date
        * Historical maximum user count
        * Active user count
        * License key

        For air-gapped or closed network customers, weâ€™ll continue with the existing true-up model. Seat Link is available in 12.9, but we will not start processing prorated charges until a future date, with a tentative target of 12.10.

        For more details, see [the recent blog post](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2020/03/16/how-were-improving-self-managed-billing/).
