      description: |
        Up until this release, the only way to upload Designs to GitLab was to click and use the file uploader. This worked but is not as efficient as using drag-and-drop. With this release you can now do the following in the Designs tab:

        - Upload a new Design by dragging a new file and dropping into the dropzone.
        - Upload a new version of an existing Design by dragging a new file with the same name and dropping into the existing Design.
