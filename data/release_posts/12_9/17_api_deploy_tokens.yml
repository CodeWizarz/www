    description: |
      Deploy tokens allow users to fetch a project repository (through SSH with `git clone`) or to fetch the Container Registry images of a project without providing a username and a password. This enables users to create a single token for their project and avoid using personal access tokens. However, for organizations with many groups, sub-groups, and projects, it is inefficient and difficult to create deploy tokens for each project. Maintainers or administrators need a way to easily create and revoke deploy tokens for many groups and projects.

      In GitLab 12.9, we are excited to announce that we have extended the Gitlab API to allow users to create, list, and revoke GitLab Deploy Tokens at the group/sub-group/project level. This will make the process of creating and managing deploy tokens much easier and safer.
