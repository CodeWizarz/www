        Sharing a link to the Design tab is an important part of collaboration and how users can surface Designs in comments or descriptions. Currently, when sharing a link to the Design tab in markdown, the link is long and unruly: `https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/12345/designs`.

        With this release, GitLab renders these links in a readable way so it's easy to distinguish Designs in issue descriptions or comments: `#12345 (designs)`. Now it's easier for collaborators to spot when a user is referring to Designs rather than just linking out to an issue.
