      description: |
        Digging through a large list of errors to find the important ones that are impacting users can be a challenge when there is a low signal to noise ratio. You can now filter the list view of Sentry errors in GitLab by error status (ignored, resolved, or unresolved) to remove the cruft and focus on the problems you actually need to fix.
