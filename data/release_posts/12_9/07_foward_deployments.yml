      description: |
        Before GitLab 12.9, users trying to roll out a pipeline could encounter a situation where an older and delayed pipeline would deploy after a newer deployment and override it. Now, forward deployments provide the option to ensure that when a pipeline runs, it is verified to be the most recent deployment and makes sure that an older pipeline doesn't override a newer one.
