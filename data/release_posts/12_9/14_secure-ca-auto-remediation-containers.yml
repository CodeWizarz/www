      description: |
        When Container Scanning finds a known vulnerability for your base image,
        GitLab offers a suggested solution (upgrading to the next version of
        the vulnerable package) where applicable. Users must select **Resolve with merge request** and submit the
        merge request that is generated with the proposed solution. This helps you
        swiftly and efficiently respond to and resolve container-based security
        findings while reducing your security risk and compliance risk. Please provide
        feedback for desired improvements [in this epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2455).
