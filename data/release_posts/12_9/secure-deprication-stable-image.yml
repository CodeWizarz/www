    description: |
      GitLab Secure tools have historically leveraged an `x-y-stable` docker tag to tie the scanners to the release version of GitLab. We are moving to publish docker images matching [semantic versions](https://semver.org/) of our tools (Major.minor.patch).
      Semantic versioning provides a number of benefits, which include:

        * The Docker image version will  match the version in each analyzer's `CHANGELOG`, so it's easier to understand what features come with a specific version of the analyzer.
        * Users can choose their level of stability: no changes (pin to `major.minor.patch`), patch fixes only (pin to `major.minor`), new features and patch fixes (pin to `major`), bleeding edge (pin to `edge`).

      We will continue releasing `x-y-stable` docker images until we officially drop support for them as early as %13.0. To prevent the failure of Secure scan jobs with **customized** [vendored templates](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml) after this transition, users can follow [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/207128) for details on how to update/migrate existing templates.
