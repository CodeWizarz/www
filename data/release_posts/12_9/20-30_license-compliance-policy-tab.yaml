        Previously, developers could only view license policies for newly added
        licenses in a merge request. With GitLab 12.9, all participants can now easily
        view a list of all licenses detected in a project, as well as a list of all of the License Policies that have been
        configured for the project. Developers will now easily be able to
        proactively verify if a license will be permitted in the project. This new
        view also allows maintainers to add or edit licenses policies from within
        the new tab.
