    description: |
      Securely managing secrets stored in CI/CD variables is a must. You can hide variable values in job logs by masking the variables, but GitLab only support certain characters. Now we support masking variables with '~' in the value, which expands the feature to support more secrets generated from other secrets provider platforms. Thank you to [dallmair](https://gitlab.com/dallmair) for the community contribution!
