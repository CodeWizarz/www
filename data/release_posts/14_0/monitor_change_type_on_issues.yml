    description: |
      In some cases, you may wish to change an issue's type. For example, you may want to escalate an issue to an [incident](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/operations/incident_management/index.html) to ensure that your team handles the problem properly. To change an issue's type, edit the issue and select an issue type from the **Issue type** selector menu.
