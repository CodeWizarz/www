    description: |
      Pronouns have been added to GitLab user profiles. The pronouns appear next to user names in the **Profile** tab. You can:

      - Decide whether or not to add pronouns to your profile.
      - Self-identify and enter whatever pronouns you prefer, without selecting from a predefined list.

      Besides being more inclusive, GitLab wants help people use the correct pronouns when replying to comments to respect people's identity.
