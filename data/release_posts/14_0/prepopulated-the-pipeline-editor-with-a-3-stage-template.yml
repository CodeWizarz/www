    description: |
      The pipeline editor in GitLab is your one-stop shop when interacting with CI/CD pipelines. Previously, when writing your first pipeline with the editor, you were presented with a blank configuration. While perfectly useful for experienced pipeline authors, it was a bit of a leap for those just starting out.

      In this release, if a project does not have a pipeline configured, the editor preloads a template showing an example 3-stage pipeline. You can save and run this pipeline right away to see it in action in your project. On top of that, it also has comments that help you understand the syntax, and tips and hints to help you start customizing the template to match your needs. It is now much easier to get your first green pipeline!
