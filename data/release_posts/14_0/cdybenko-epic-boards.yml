      Epic Boards align teams and organizations by communicating the status of epics continuously. Previous versions of GitLab required you to view and sort epics in a list to view the overall status. Keeping epics up to date meant making most changes through an epic's detail page. Epic Boards enable you to visualize and refine all of your epics in one place, using a customizable, drag-and-drop interface that is easy for any teammate to understand and collaborate.

      Epic Boards are also a game-changer for managing and visualizing ideal epic workflows, such as authoring workflow states (Draft, Writing, Done), DevOps workflow states (such as Planned, In Development, and In Production), or any other mutually exclusive states you might model with scoped labels. Visualizing workflows with an Epic Board empowers you to increase predictability and efficiency.
