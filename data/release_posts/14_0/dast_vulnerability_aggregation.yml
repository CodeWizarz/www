    description: |
      In GitLab 13.12 and earlier, all DAST vulnerabilities found in a scan were listed individually for each URL the vulnerability was found on. This could create many vulnerabilities when the fix was a single file or configuration change. For example: an issue with a server header sent with every HTTP response would be reported on every page on the site, rather than reported as a single issue with multiple occurrences.

      To reduce the overhead of managing vulnerabilities, GitLab combines identical vulnerabilities found on multiple pages into a single reported vulnerability in the DAST report. The vulnerability details include a list of all the URLs where the vulnerability was found, rather than individual vulnerabilities being created in the vulnerability list and dashboard for each page.

      This new reporting functionality will not retroactively combine vulnerabilities found in previous scans. It only applies to scans performed in GitLab 14.0 and later.
