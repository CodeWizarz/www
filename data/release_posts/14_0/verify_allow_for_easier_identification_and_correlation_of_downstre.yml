    description: |
      Previously, when looking at the pipeline view, it was difficult to determine which job triggered a downstream pipeline. Starting in 14.0, every downstream pipeline shows the name of the job that triggered it. This makes it easier to track the execution flow in complex pipelines that trigger downstream pipelines.
