    description: |
       Forking a project enables you to have an exact copy of an original repository where you can experiment, apply changes, and submit contributions to the parent project. Your forks should have meaningful names that explain their goals, and if your project is diverging, you may need multiple forks of a single project.

       In this release, GitLab now supports editing the project name and project slug directly when you create a fork. You can now create multiple forks of the same project, each with a different name, all in the same group!
