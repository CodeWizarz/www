    description: |
      In GitLab Runner 13.3, a symlink was added from `/user/lib/gitlab-runner/gitlab-runner` to `/usr/bin/gitlab-runner`. In 14.0, the symlink has been removed and the runner is now installed in `/usr/bin/gitlab-runner`. Refer to [issue #26651](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/issues/26651) for details.
