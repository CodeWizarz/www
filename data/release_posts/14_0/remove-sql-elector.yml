  description: |
    Now that Praefect supports a [primary election strategy](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/gitaly/praefect.html#repository-specific-primary-nodes) for each repository, we have removed the `sql` election strategy.
    The `per_repository` election strategy is the new default, which is automatically used if no election strategy was specified.

    If you had configured the `sql` election strategy, you must follow the [migration instructions](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/gitaly/praefect.html#migrate-to-repository-specific-primary-gitaly-nodes) before upgrading to 14.0.
