      In 14.0, we are now pulling the GitLab Runner [helper image](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/configuration/advanced-configuration.html#helper-image) from the GitLab Container Registry instead of Docker Hub. Refer to [issue #27218](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/issues/27218) for details.
