      description: |
        You use the GitLab Package Registry to publish, install, and share your dependencies. When you publish a dependency, it generates several files including the package archive. Prior to GitLab 14.0, to delete such files you had to [use the API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/packages.html#delete-a-package-file). In GitLab 14.0, you can now use the UI to delete files related to a given package, and the package itself.

        Since maintaining a tidy registry can be challenging, our goal is to make the process easier and more efficient for you by adding more options for how to delete unused files.
