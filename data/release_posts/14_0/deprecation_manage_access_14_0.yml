    description: |
     GitLab is deprecating the [OAuth 2 implicit grant flow](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/oauth2.html#implicit-grant-flow) as it has been removed for [OAuth 2.1](https://oauth.net/2.1/).

     Beginning in 14.0, new applications can't be created with the OAuth 2 implicit grant flow. Existing OAuth implicit grant flows are no longer supported in 14.4. Migrate your existing applications to other supported [OAuth2 flows](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/oauth2.html#supported-oauth2-flows) before release 14.4.
