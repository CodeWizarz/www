      The WIP (work in progress) status for merge requests signaled to reviewers that the merge request in question wasn't ready to merge. We've renamed the WIP feature to **Draft**, a more inclusive and self-explanatory term. **Draft** clearly communicates the merge request in question isn't ready for review, and makes no assumptions about the progress being made toward it. **Draft** also reduces the cognitive load for new users, non-English speakers, and anyone unfamiliar with the WIP acronym.
