        You can use your project's Package Registry to publish and install PyPI packages. When you install a PyPI package, you must specify which project the package resides in. This works well if you have a small number of projects. If you have multiple projects nested within a group, you might quickly find yourself adding dozens or even hundreds of different sources.

        For large organizations with many teams, it's common for a team to publish packages to their project's Package Registry alongside the source code and pipelines. However, they must also be able to easily install dependencies from other projects within their organization. You can now install packages from your group, so you don't have to remember which package lives in which project. To do this, use the simple API to specify a package: `GET groups/:id/packages/pypi/files/:sha256/:file_identifier`.

        You can also write the output to a file, or return the package descriptor as an HTML file. [Read the docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/pypi_repository/#install-a-pypi-package) for more info and let us know how it goes. We hope that this helps to make your team and organization more efficient.
