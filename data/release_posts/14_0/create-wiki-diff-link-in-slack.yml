      Our [Slack notification service](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/slack.html) can notify you when a user edits a wiki page. The Slack message gives you helpful context about the edit, including the project, page name, and the commit message. Sometimes, however, the commit message doesn't give enough context, and you need more information about how the content changed. 
      
      Now you can click **Compare changes** in the Slack message to immediately view the diff, saving you time and reducing confusion from ambiguous or incomplete commit messages.
