    description: |
      Previously, to access the user lists, you had to navigate to a separate tab under the Feature Flags page. This design obscured the relationship between feature flags and user lists since user lists are a sub-feature of feature flags.
      In this release, user lists are now under a subpage of Feature Flags, which improves the workflow and makes their relationship more clear.
