      As a developer, you often spend a majority of your time working in your local development environment. When you're assigned a merge request for review, this requires you to leave your editor and perform that review inside of GitLab. While performing your review inside GitLab, you might also need to use your local editor to gain more context on the proposed changes.

      [GitLab Workflow](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitLab.gitlab-workflow) version `3.21.0` for Visual Studio Code (VS Code) now supports the complete merge request review process, including threads. Select the GitLab icon in VS Code to open the [sidebar](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-vscode-extension#sidebar-details) to display **Merge requests I'm reviewing**. Select a merge request overview to view the complete details and discussions of the merge request.

      The sidebar also contains a list of all the changed files in the merge request. Selecting files opens a diff comparison for you to review the changes in VS Code. While viewing the diff, you can read feedback left on the files, and create new comments by selecting a line number and creating your comment. All comments and feedback you provide in VS Code are available in the GitLab web interface, making it easy for you to perform your reviews in VS Code, and other users to participate in GitLab.

      We're really excited about bringing the complete merge request review process to you inside of VS Code. Let us know what you think by [opening an issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-vscode-extension/-/issues/new?issue%5Bmilestone_id%5D=) for GitLab Workflow.
