      GitLab is big. And it's getting bigger. As we've introduced new features and categories, navigating the densely-packed left sidebar has become less intuitive.
      
      In GitLab 14.0 we've redesigned and restructured the left sidebar for improved usability, consistency, and discoverability. We've moved some links to features around, split up features in the **Operations** menu into three distinct menus, improved visual contrast, and optimized spacing so all the menu items can fit comfortably on a smaller screen. These changes are intended to better match your mental model of the DevOps lifecycle, and provide a more predictable and consistent experience while navigating within your projects and groups.
