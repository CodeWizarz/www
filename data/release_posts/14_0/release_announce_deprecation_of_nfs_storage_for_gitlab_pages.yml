  description: |
    To make GitLab Pages cloud-native compatible, starting in GitLab 14.0, we're changing the underlying storage architecture used by GitLab Pages to the [recently introduced ZIP storage](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/pages/#zip-storage).

    The migration to the new ZIP archives architecture is designed to be automatic, however, if after the migration you see `404 Not Found` for some Pages, the automatic migration has probably failed. To ease this transition to ZIP storage, we've provided a temporary [`use_legacy_storage` flag](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/pages/#gitlab-pages-doesnt-work-after-upgrading-to-gitlab-140-or-above) from GitLab 14.0 to 14.2, but we will remove it in GitLab 14.3. This flag will allow GitLab and GitLab Pages to use the non-ZIP deployments to serve content.
