    description: |
      Ubuntu 16.04 [reached end-of-life in April 2021](https://ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle), and no longer receives maintenance updates. We strongly recommend users to upgrade to a newer release, such as 20.04.

      GitLab 13.12 will be the last release with Ubuntu 16.04 support.
