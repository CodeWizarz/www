      In GitLab Runner 13.0, [issue #5069](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/issues/5069), we introduced new timing options for the GitLab Docker Machine executor. In GitLab Runner 14.0, we have removed the old configuration option, [off peak time mode](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/configuration/autoscale.html#off-peak-time-mode-configuration-deprecated).
