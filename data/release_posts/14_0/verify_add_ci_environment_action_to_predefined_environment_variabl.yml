       If you want to reuse scripts and configuration between deployment jobs using the `environment:` keyword, it can be difficult to exclude certain behaviors based on the type of action the deployment job performs. For example, an `environment: action` of `stop` might be a job that is stopping a `review_app`, and you don't want your deployment scripts to run.

        Now, the value of `environment: action:` is available as the `CI_ENVIRONMENT_ACTION` predefined CI/CD variable, making it easier than ever to configure one script that can work for all deployment jobs.
