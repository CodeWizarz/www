    description: |
      The Incident Service Level Agreement (SLA) Timer, introduced in GitLab 13.5, shows the time remaining until an SLA violation for an incident.
      However, the user had to refresh the page to update the timer. Starting in GitLab 14.0, the timer updates dynamically every 15 minutes without the need for a page refresh.
