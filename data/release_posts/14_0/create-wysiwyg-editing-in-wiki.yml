      Editing wiki content could be so much easier! Many GitLab wikis use Markdown formatting, and for some users, Markdown is a barrier to efficient collaboration. In this release, you now have access to a rich, modern Markdown editing experience in your wiki, so you can edit with confidence.
      
      Instant feedback and visual editing tools help make wiki editing more intuitive, and remove barriers to collaboration. GitLab saves the changes as Markdown when you're done, so users who want to edit the Markdown directly can do so. You can even type Markdown into the new editor and it will automatically format the text as you type.

      GitLab 14.0 introduces the [Content Editor](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5401) into the Wiki with support for most of the basic Markdown content types like headers, bold and italic text, lists, code blocks, and links. [Full support](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5438) for the entire [GitLab Flavored Markdown specification](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html) will arrive in upcoming releases. We also plan to make the Content Editor available in other areas of GitLab in the future. We welcome input on this early MVC in [this feedback issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/332629).
