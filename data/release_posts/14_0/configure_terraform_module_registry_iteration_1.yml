    description: |
      Terraform modules play a central role in building standard infrastructure components throughout an organization. Up to GitLab 13.12, GitLab users had to use either a third-party Terraform module registry, local modules, or Git-based modules. While these options work well, they do not help with the distribution of the modules and they lack proper versioning support, which introduces risks for module users. GitLab 14.0 extends our [Infrastructure-as-Code offerings](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/infrastructure/) with a Terraform module registry. Now, you can use the Terraform module registry built into GitLab to discover Terraform modules with semantic versioning support for upgrades and maintenance. Moreover, you can publish modules easily using GitLab CI/CD.

      While following Terraform's best practices, we recommend developing each Terraform module in a dedicated GitLab project. To simplify the transition to the registry, users can host and publish multiple modules from a single GitLab repository. You can learn more about publishing and consuming a new module [in our documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/terraform_module_registry/index.html).
