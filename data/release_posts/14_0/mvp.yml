    Mathieu has contributed significantly to the Package stage with his work on both the Debian and Helm package registries. These direction features have been fully contributed by Mathieu thus far.

    The effort to implement [Debian packages](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6057) has been ongoing since September of 2020. Approximately 38 MRs merged so far, and now we are nearing the end of the [iterative plan](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6057#note_582697034) that Mathieu put together and maintained. As a result of Mathieu's efforts, we are just a few merge requests away from feature completion and release.

    Mathieu also planned the [Helm Charts Package Manager](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/18997#note_530270349) effort and has been working on that over the past three months. In this work, Mathieu has embraced the GitLab values of iteration and collaboration, working closely with the entire Package team and beyond on these and many other features.

    Thank you for all of your amazing work, Mathieu!
