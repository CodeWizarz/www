    description: |
      Typically, large enterprise organizations have an explicit permission boundary between developers and operators. Developers may deploy and test the application on lower-tier environments such as the development environment. Operators are responsible for deploying to higher-tier environments such as the production environment. Furthermore, in organizations where there are potentially thousands of projects under a single group, ensuring that all of the project-level protected environments are properly configured is not a scalable solution.

      In this release, we are introducing group-level protected environments, based on the [deployment tier](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/environments/index.html#deployment-tier-of-environments) as the identifier. This enables operators to responsibly lock down deployments to higher tier environments without unnecessarily preventing developers from doing their work as the maintainers of their individual projects.
