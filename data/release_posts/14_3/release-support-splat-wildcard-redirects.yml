    description: |
      GitLab Pages supports a variety of redirect rules, including [redirects](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/redirects.html#redirects) and [rewrites](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/redirects.html#rewrites). In this release, you can now also use splats (aka wildcard) and placeholders to redirect your Pages content to specific pages.
