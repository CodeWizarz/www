    description: |
      In GitLab 14.3, we added support to Kubernetes version 1.20. GitLab users can benefit from having recent cluster versions in many features, such as the [GitLab Agent for Kubernetes](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/clusters/agent/), [Auto DevOps](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/autodevops/) and [Cluster Management Project](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/clusters/management_project.html).

      You can find the list of [supported versions and related timelines in our documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/clusters/#supported-cluster-versions).
