    description: |
      To reduce build times, avoid Docker Hub rate limits, and reduce your external dependencies, you can use the GitLab Dependency Proxy to proxy and cache container images from Docker Hub.

      Previously, you had no way of knowing how the Dependency Proxy was being used. For example, for your GitLab group, maybe you wanted to know how many container images were added to the cache, or you wanted to view details about items already in the cache.

      Now you can use the GitLab GraphQL API to quickly find these important details. You can use the new API to uncover details about the images and their underlying components, so that you can know for certain which container images and tags are being used in your group. 

      Next up, we'll use the new API to deliver a significant update to the user interface. [GitLab issue 250865](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/250865) proposes an update to the UI to add helpful metadata for quick reference.
