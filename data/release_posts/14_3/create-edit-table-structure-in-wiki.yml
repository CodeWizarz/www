      Editing a Markdown table that has 9 columns and 25 rows is one thing. But adding a tenth column to that table in Markdown? That involves very repetitive and error-prone edits to every row. One mistake or misplaced `|` and the table fails to render.

      The new WYSIWYG Markdown editor in the wiki lets you quickly and easily insert a table using the button in the toolbar. After selecting the initial number of rows and columns, however, dealing with the structure of the table can be more difficult. In GitLab 14.3, you can now click on the caret icon in the top right corner of any selected cell to add or remove columns and rows, either before or after the selected cell. Now, as your content scales, the complexity doesn't follow suit.
