    description: |
      The project pipelines list at **CI/CD > Pipelines** shows all pipelines for a project, but you could not filter the list by pipeline **source**. Now, in GitLab 14.3, you can easily filter the pipeline list based on sources like `api`, `schedule`, `merge_request_event`, and so on.
