      description: |
        If you use IBM POWER9 (`ppc64le` compute architecture) systems for compute-intensive workloads, you have not had runners available from GitLab. You've had to rely on your own runner, or on a runner built and maintained by IBM. While this allowed you to run your GitLab CI/CD jobs on POWER9, it was less than ideal. The binary was not part of the GitLab Runner release and support lifecycle. You can now install and use a runner built and supported by GitLab to execute GitLab CI/CD jobs on IBM POWER9 (Linux OS).
