  description: |
    In GitLab 14.3, we will remove the ability to filter by `name` in the [list project pipelines API endpoint](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/pipelines.html#list-project-pipelines) to improve performance. If you currently use this parameter with this endpoint, you must switch to `username`.
