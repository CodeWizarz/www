    description: |
      Audit events are now created if changes are made to the [merge request approval settings](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/approvals/settings.html)
      in a project. You can now see if a change is made to the following policies:

      - Requiring user password for approvals.
      - Allowing modifying merge request approvals in a merge request.
      - Needing to get new approvals when a new commit is added to a merge request.

      You can now be confident that once you configure approval settings, you can quickly see
      if they are changed. This is a great way to show auditors that controls were put in place
      and have not been removed or modified.
