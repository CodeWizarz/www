    description: |
      The GitLab Agent for Kubernetes provides a secure connection between a Kubernetes cluster and GitLab. Until GitLab 14.2, the CI/CD Tunnel could only provide access to a cluster from CI/CD jobs ran in the Agent for Kubernetes's configuration project. In GitLab 14.3, we introduced support for groups to access the Agent through the CI/CD Tunnel. As a result, every project under the authorized group has access to the cluster without the need to register an agent for every project.
