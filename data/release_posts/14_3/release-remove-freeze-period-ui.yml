    description: |
      To prevent unintentional deployments of your CI/CD jobs, you can set deploy freeze periods. Up until recently, it was possible to remove a deploy freeze period only by using the API. This release improves the ease of use by allowing you to remove a deploy freeze period directly from the GitLab interface.
      This feature is a community contribution. Thank you [@jayaddison](https://gitlab.com/jayaddison) for adding this useful feature to GitLab!
