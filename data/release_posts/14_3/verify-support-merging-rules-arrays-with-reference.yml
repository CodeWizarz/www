    description: |
      The YAML [`!reference` tag](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/yaml_optimization.html#reference-tags) introduced earlier this year helps you reuse and combine configuration. This is a very flexible way to combine frequently reused configuration with job-specific configuration in one or more jobs. However, using it with the [`rules`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#rules) keyword was not supported yet. In 14.3, we've added `!reference` support to the `rules` keyword, so you can now mix and match `rules` more easily, including with configuration from different files. You can use the CI/CD pipeline editor to [view the merged configuration](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipeline_editor/#view-expanded-configuration).
