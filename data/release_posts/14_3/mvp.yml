    @feistel started contributing to GitLab Pages in September 2020. In the last 4 months, they have made continuous contributions to improve Pages by adding features, fixing bugs, and helping us clear the Pages issues backlog.
    In 14.3, they took the initiative to work on some of the release group [deliverable issues for the milestone](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ci-cd/release-group/release/-/issues/66#deliverables-fox), allowing us to focus on reviews and giving us more time to work on other issues.

    They have also started contributing to other Go projects like in [GitLab Runner](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/merge_requests/3101), [GitLab Shell](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-shell/-/merge_requests/509), the [container registry](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/container-registry/-/merge_requests/738), and more.
    They also engage in [code reviews](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-pages/-/merge_requests/458#note_649747756).
    They recently [created a tool](https://gitlab.com/feistel/canwebumpgoyet) that allows us to check if we can upgrade the Go version of a project using a simple CLI tool, [see an example](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-pages/-/merge_requests/547).
    Here is a [full list of their contributions](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/merge_requests?scope=all&state=opened&author_username=feistel).
    Thank you!
