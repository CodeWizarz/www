deprecations:
- feature_name: Legacy database configuration
  due: May 22, 2022
  description: |
    The syntax of [GitLabs database](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/settings/database.html)
    configuration located in `database.yml` is changing and the legacy format is deprecated. The legacy format
    supported using a single PostgreSQL adapter, whereas the new format is changing to support multiple databases. The `main:` database needs to be defined as a first configuration item.

    This deprecation mainly impacts users compiling GitLab from source because Omnibus will handle this configuration automatically.
- feature_name: Audit events for repository push events
  due: May 22, 2022
  description: |
    Audit events for [repository events](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/audit_events.html#repository-push) are now deprecated and will be removed in GitLab 15.0.

    These events have always been disabled by default and had to be manually enabled with a
    feature flag. Enabling them can cause too many events to be generated which can
    dramatically slow down GitLab instances. For this reason, they are being removed.
- feature_name: OmniAuth Kerberos gem
  due: May 22, 2022
  description: |
    The `omniauth-kerberos` gem will be removed in our next major release, GitLab 15.0.

    This gem has not been maintained and has very little usage. We therefore plan to remove support for this authentication method and recommend using the Kerberos [SPNEGO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPNEGO) integration instead. You can follow the [upgrade instructions](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/kerberos.html#upgrading-from-password-based-to-ticket-based-kerberos-sign-ins) to upgrade from the `omniauth-kerberos` integration to the supported one.

    Note that we are not deprecating the Kerberos SPNEGO integration, only the old password-based Kerberos integration.
- feature_name: GitLab Serverless
  due: May 22, 2022
  description: |
    [GitLab Serverless](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/clusters/serverless/) is a feature set to support Knative-based serverless development with automatic deployments and monitoring.

    We decided to remove the GitLab Serverless features as they never really resonated with our users. Besides, given the continuous development of Kubernetes and Knative, our current implementations do not even work with recent versions.
