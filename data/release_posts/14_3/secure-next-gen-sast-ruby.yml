    description: |
        GitLab SAST historically has been powered by [over a dozen open-source static analysis security analyzers](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#supported-languages-and-frameworks). These analyzers have proactively identified millions of vulnerabilities for developers using GitLab every month. These tools use a variety of different approaches for identifying vulnerabilities from basic regex pattern matching to abstract syntax tree parsing which can lead to issues with false positives. GitLab's Secure tools already offer vulnerability fingerprinting allowing you to dismiss these false positives persistently, however, we want to go a step further and not require this manual triaging.

        Today we're releasing the first version of our proprietary static application security testing engine built in-house and maintained by GitLab's Static Analysis and Vulnerability Research groups. Initially, this tool is focused on Ruby and Rails to help reduce false positives.
        GitLab's Next Generation SAST engine takes the learnings we've gained from years of running and maintaining the open source security tools that power GitLab SAST today and applying state-of-the-art program analysis techniques. This new engine leverages program representations that include data and control flow analysis and a novel pattern extraction language which can be used for both vulnerability detection and to eliminate vulnerabilities that may have been falsely reported by other integrated security tools. This engine also provides us the framework to start integrating different types of security testing offered within GitLab Ultimate to make them all smarter.

        As your source code management, CI/CD, and security scanning provider, GitLab is uniquely positioned to deeply integrate security testing across your software development lifecycle (SDLC) to bring you fast, accurate, and scalable security results. We're excited about the future of this new proprietary engine, and we look forward to expanding its availability, language coverage, and detection capabilities in future releases.
