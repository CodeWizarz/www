    description: |
      Including multimedia in a wiki page is a great way to effectively and efficiently communicate complex content. GitLab Flavored Markdown supports embedding [video and audio content](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html#videos) for playback. However, when you're editing the page, the media is represented in code by the path to the file, and that can lead to confusion or uncertainty around whether you uploaded the right version of the file.

      In GitLab 14.3, the new WYSIWYG Markdown editor in the Wiki renders and plays back existing video and audio content on the page right in the editor. Now you can be sure that the `recording_final.mp3` or `walkthrough.mp4` you attached is indeed the right asset without leaving the editor. Currently, this only applies to media already included in the page when it's loaded into the editor. We will add support for [inserting new video and audio content](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/332088) from the editor in an upcoming milestone.

      Thanks to [Lee Tickett](https://gitlab.com/leetickett) for this helpful contribution!
