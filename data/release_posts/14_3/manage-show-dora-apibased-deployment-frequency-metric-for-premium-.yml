    description: |
      This change enables the DORA API-based Deployment Frequency metric in group-level Value Stream Analytics for Premium customers. This can help you understand how often you are delivering increased value to your users. Also, higher deployment frequency means you are able to get feedback and iterate more quickly in delivering improvements and features.
