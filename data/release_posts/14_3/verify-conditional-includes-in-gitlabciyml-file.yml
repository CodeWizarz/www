    description: |
      [`include`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#include) is one of the most popular keywords to use when writing a full CI/CD pipeline. If you are building larger pipelines, you are probably using the `include` keyword to bring external YAML configuration into your pipeline.

      In this release, we are expanding the power of the keyword so you can use `include` with [`rules`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#include) conditions. Now, you can decide when external CI/CD configuration should or shouldn't be included. This will help you write a standardized pipeline with the ability to dynamically modify itself based on the conditions you choose.
