      description: |
        If you used [matrix jobs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#parallel-matrix-jobs), you probably noticed it was difficult to determine which matrix variables were used for each job, because the job names were formatted like `matrix 1/4`. In 13.4, you will now see the relevant variable values that were used in that job, instead of seeing a generic job name. For example, if you are building a debug target for x86 architecture, the job will now be named `matrix: debug x86`.
