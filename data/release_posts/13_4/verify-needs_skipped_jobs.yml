      description: |
        In certain edge cases, it was possible for a skipped job in your pipeline to be considered successful for `needs` dependencies, which allowed later jobs to run that shouldn't have. This is fixed in 13.4, and the behavior of skipped jobs is now handled properly by `needs`.
