      In GitLab Runner 13.1, [issue #3376](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/issues/3376), we began sending `sigterm` and then `sigkill` to a process in the Shell executor. We also introduced a new feature flag, `FF_SHELL_EXECUTOR_USE_LEGACY_PROCESS_KILL`, which allowed you to use the previous process termination method. In GitLab Runner 14.0, [issue #6413](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/issues/6413), we will remove the feature flag.
