      description: |
        We improved alerts by adding an alert-specific reference in GitLab-flavored Markdown, making it easy for you to share and reference alerts. Use `^alert#1234` to reference an alert in any Markdown field in incidents, issues, or merge requests. This alert reference also helps you identify to-dos resulting from alerts, rather than issues or merge requests!
