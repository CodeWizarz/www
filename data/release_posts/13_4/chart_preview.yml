        Previously, creating a chart in your GitLab metrics dashboard was challenging. After you defined a chart in the dashboard YAML file, you committed the changes to `master` without knowing the newly-created chart was what you wanted. Since GitLab 13.3, you can preview a panel's YAML as the chart is created, getting you early feedback before committing the changes to your dashboard's YAML file.
