      description: |
        An incident's severity tells responders and stakeholders the impact of an outage, and the methods and urgency needed for responses. As your team shares findings during the fire-fight and remediates the outage, they can edit the incident's severity. You can now edit the severity of the incident in the right-hand sidebar of the Incident Details page, and the severity is displayed in the incident list.
