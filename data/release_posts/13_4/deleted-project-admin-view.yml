        Thank you to [Ashesh Vidyut (@asheshvidyut7)](https://gitlab.com/asheshvidyut7) for this community contribution!

        The ability to delay project deletion was [introduced in 12.6](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/32935). However, previously there was no way to see all projects pending deletion in one place. Now self-managed administrators can view all projects pending deletion in a single view, along with buttons to easily restore these projects.

        This capability allows self-managed administrators to have better control of project deletion by aggregating this information in a single place and providing the opportunity to undo undesirable deletion activity.
