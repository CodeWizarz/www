        You can use the GitLab PyPI Repository to build, publish, and share python packages, right alongside your source code and CI/CD Pipelines. However, previously you couldn't authenticate with the repository by using the pre-defined environment variable `CI_JOB_TOKEN`. As a result, you were forced to use your personal credentials for making updates to the PyPI Repository, or you may have decided not to use the repository at all.

        Now it is easier than ever to use GitLab CI/CD to publish and install PyPI packages by using the predefined `CI_JOB_TOKEN` environment variable.
