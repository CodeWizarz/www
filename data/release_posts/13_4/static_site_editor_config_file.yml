        In GitLab 13.4, we're introducing a new way to configure the Static Site Editor. While the configuration file doesn't store or retrieve any values in this release, we're laying the foundation for customization of the editor's behavior. In upcoming releases, we'll add values to `.gitlab/static-site-editor.yml` for setting the [site's base URL](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/241166), where [images uploaded from the editor are stored](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/216641), overriding Markdown syntax preferences, and other editor-specific settings.
