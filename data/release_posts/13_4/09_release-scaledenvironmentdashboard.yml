      description: |
        Since GitLab 12.5, you could only see 7 environments across 3 projects with the [Environment Dashboard](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/3713). We've improved the Environment Dashboard in GitLab 13.4 by paginating the dashboard to help you support and manage your environments at scale. You can now see more environments across many projects.
