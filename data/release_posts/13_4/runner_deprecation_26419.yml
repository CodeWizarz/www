    description: |
      In GitLab Runner 13.2, PowerShell Core support was added to the shell executor. In 14.0, `pwsh` will be the default shell for runners that are registered on Windows. The Windows Command shell will still be available as an option for Windows runners. Refer to [issue #26419](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/issues/26419) for additional details.
