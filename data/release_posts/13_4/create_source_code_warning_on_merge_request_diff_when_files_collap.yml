      description: |
        Collapsing large files on a merge request diff is done to enhance the performance
        and responsiveness of the diff section in a merge request. However, during code review,
        some files may be missed by the reviewer when scrolling through the list of files, because
        large files are collapsed.

        We have introduced a visible warning at the top of the merge request diff page, clearly
        informing the user that a file in the section is collapsed. This ensures all
        related changes in the merge request are reviewed.
