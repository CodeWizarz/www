      description: |
       When a reviewer sets a merge request (MR) to **Merge When Pipeline Succeeds (MWPS)**, no email notification is sent. You must manually check to see the status or wait for the notification when the MR is merged. In this release we are excited to include a community contribution by [@ravishankar2kool](https://gitlab.com/ravishankar2kool) which solves this problem by automatically notifying all the subscribers in the merge request thread when a reviewer sets the MR to MWPS.
