        As a developer, you should be able to easily see code coverage after a pipeline finishes running, even in complex scenarios that make this more difficult, like when your pipeline has multiple jobs that are parsed to calculate the coverage value. Until now, the Merge Request widget only showed the average of those values, which meant you had to navigate to the jobs page and then back to the Merge Request itself to get more granular details for the coverage value. To save you time and eliminate those extra steps, you're now presented with the average coverage value, how it has changed from the target and source branch, and a tooltip that shows the coverage for each job used to calculate the average.
