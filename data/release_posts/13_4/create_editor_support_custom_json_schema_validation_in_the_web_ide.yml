      description: |
        Projects that rely on people writing configurations in JSON or YAML format can cause problems because it's easy to make a typo and break things. It's possible to write validation tools that catch this in the CI pipeline but using a JSON schema file can be helpful for offering documentation and hints.

        Project contributors can define a custom schema path in the `.gitlab/.gitlab-webide.yml` file in their repository which specifies the schema and path of files to validate. When loading the defined file in the Web IDE additional feedback and validation will be visible to help create the file.
