      description: |
        Front matter is a flexible and convenient way to define page-specific variables in data files intended to be parsed by a static site generator. It is commonly used for setting a page's title, layout template, or author, but can be used to pass any kind of metadata to the generator as the page renders out to HTML. Included at the very top of each data file, the front matter is often formatted as YAML or JSON and requires consistent and accurate syntax. Collaborators unfamiliar with the specific syntax rules can inadvertently introduce invalid markup that can in turn cause formatting issues or even build failures.

        The Static Site Editor's WYSIWYG editing mode already removes the front matter from the editor to prevent these formatting errors. However, that leaves you with no way to modify the values stored in the front matter without reverting to editing the raw source of the file. In GitLab 13.4, you can access and edit the values for each front matter field in a familiar form-based interface. Clicking the **Settings** button will reveal a panel that displays a form field for each key defined in the front matter. The fields are populated with the current value and editing any of them is as simple as typing into a web form. Editing front matter in this way allows you to avoid syntax complexities and gives you complete control over the content while ensuring the final output is formatted consistently.
