        Effective communication in GitLab relies on the To-Do List. If you are mentioned in a comment, it's critical to be able to follow the to do and either take action or mark it as done. It's also important to be able to give yourself to dos when you need to remember to work on something or come back later.

        Until now, it was super frustrating that you could not add a to do or mark it as done on Designs. This really impaired the effectiveness of communication between product teams as to dos are essential to managing the flow of work in GitLab.

        As of 13.4, Designs achieve parity with Issue comments and their use of to dos for a more consistent and useful experience!
