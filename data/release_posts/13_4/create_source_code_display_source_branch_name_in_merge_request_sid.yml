      description: |
        When reviewing code changes, discussions, and commits in a merge request, it is often desirable
        to checkout the branch locally for a more in-depth review. However, finding the branch name
        becomes harder as more content is added to the merge request description as more scrolling is
        necessary.

        The branch name has now been added to the merge request sidebar, making it easily accessible at
        all times and removing the need for scrolling. Just as the merge request reference, the source
        branch section provides a convenient "copy" button for easy local checkout.

        Many thanks to [Ethan Reesor](https://gitlab.com/firelizzard) for this great contribution.
