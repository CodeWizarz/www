      description: |
        When using parent/child pipelines, it is now possible for child pipelines to trigger
        their own child pipelines. This added depth can be useful when you want the flexibility
        to generate a variable number of child pipelines.

        Before, with a parent/child configuration, every child pipeline needed a trigger
        job manually defined in the parent. Now you can generate child pipelines that dynamically
        trigger any number of new child pipelines. If you have a monorepo, for example, you
        can dynamically generate a first child pipeline that itself generates a variable
        number of new child pipelines, based on the changes in a branch.
