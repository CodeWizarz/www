      description: |
        GitLab will now automatically lock the latest artifact of a successful job and pipeline on any active branch, MR, or tag to prevent it from being deleted based on expiration. This makes it easier to set a more aggressive expiration policy to clean up older artifacts, helps reduce disk space consumption, and ensures you've always got a copy of the latest artifact from your pipeline.
