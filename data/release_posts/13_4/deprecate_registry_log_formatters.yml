deprecations:
  - feature_name: Deprecate Container Registry log formatters
    due: January 22nd, 2021

      Currently, GitLab supports text/json/logstash log formatting for app logs and text/json/combined for access logs. We will deprecate both logstash and combined, unifying the formatters for both app and access logs with only two options, text (for development) and json.
