        Previously, merge requests could be dropped from the Merge Train accidentally by late comments. If a merge request was already on the merge train, and someone added a comment that created a new unresolved thread, the merge request was then considered unmergeable and dropped from the train. Now, after the merge request is added to the train, new comments can be made without any worries about disrupting the merge process.
