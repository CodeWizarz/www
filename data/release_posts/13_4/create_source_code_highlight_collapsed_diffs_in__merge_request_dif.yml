      description:
        Merge requests which apply changes to multiple files will sometimes collapse
        large file diffs in order to improve performance. When this happens, it's easy
        to overlook a file and not review it, especially in merge requests with many files.

        Starting with GitLab 13.4, the merge request will emphasize diffs containing
        collapsed files which will ensure those files are not missed by reviewers during
        the code review process. For added clarity, we are planning to highlight these files
        in a future release. Follow
        [gitlab#16047](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/16047) for updates.
