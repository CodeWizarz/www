      description: |
        Having access to previous versions of a Terraform state is necessary both for compliance and occasional debugging needs. Support for versioning of GitLab Managed Terraform state is provided starting with GitLab 13.4. Versioning is turned on automatically for new Terraform state files. Existing GitLab Managed Terraform state files will be [migrated automatically to versioned storage](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/235108) in a later release.
