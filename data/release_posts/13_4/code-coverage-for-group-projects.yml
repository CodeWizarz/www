      description: |
        When you or your team manages multiple GitLab projects, you should be able to easily see a single data point showing how code coverage is trending over time across all projects. Previously, visualizing this trend involved tedious, manual, work to download the coverage data from each project and insert it into a spreadsheet.

        Now, as team lead, you can quickly and easily gather all the code coverage data available in each of your group's projects or a selection of projects as a `.csv` file. This is an MVC feature that will be followed by the ability to [graph the average coverage over time](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/215140).
