      description: |
        A few months ago, we announced a plan to [open source 18 features](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2020/03/30/new-features-to-core/). In working towards honoring that commitment, [Related Issues](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/related_issues.html#related-issues)[1], [Issues CSV Export](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/csv_export.html), and [Issue Board Focus Mode](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issue_board.html#focus-mode) are now available in Core. This only applies to the "relates to" relationship. "Blocks" and "is blocked by" remain in paid tiers.
