        The GitLab Package Registry is where you store and share a variety of package formats. When your project or group has a large number of packages, you want to quickly identify unused packages and delete them, to prevent people from installing the wrong package. You can delete packages from your registry by using the [Packages API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/packages.html) or from the Package Registry user interface. However, until recently, you could not delete packages when viewing a group in the UI. As a result, you were forced to delete packages for each project, which was inefficient.

        Now you can delete packages while you're viewing the Package Registry for a group. Simply navigate to your group's Package Registry, filter by package name, and delete any unwanted packages.
