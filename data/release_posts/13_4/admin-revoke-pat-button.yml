      description: |
        The [Credentials inventory](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/credentials_inventory.html#credentials-inventory-ultimate-only) provides the insight administrators need to manage user access credentials for their GitLab instance. As compliance-minded organizations vary in the strictness of their credential management policies, we've added a button that allows administrators to optionally revoke a user's Personal Access Token (PAT). Administrators can now easily revoke PATs that may be compromised. This feature supports organizations that want more flexible enforcement options, to minimize disruptions to their users.
