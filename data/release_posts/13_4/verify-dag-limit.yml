        If you're using [Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) pipelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/directed_acyclic_graph/), you might have found that the limit of 10 jobs that a job can list in `needs:` is insufficient. In 13.4, the default limit was raised from 10 to 50 to allow for more complicated networks of relationships between jobs in your pipelines.

        If you are an administrator for a self-managed instance, you can make this even higher by adjusting a feature flag setting, though we don't offer official support for this.
