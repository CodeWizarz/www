        You can use the GitLab Conan Repository to publish and share C/C++ dependencies. However, packages could previously only be scoped to the instance. This was problematic because Conan package names must be 51 characters or fewer. For anyone trying to publish a package that lived within a sub-group, like `gitlab-org/ci-cd/package-stage/feature-testing/conan`, it was nearly impossible to use this feature.

        Now you can scope your Conan packages to a project, making it easy to publish and share your project's dependencies.
