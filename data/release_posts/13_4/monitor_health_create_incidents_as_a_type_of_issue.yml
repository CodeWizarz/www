      description: |
        Not every problem that arises triggers an alert first: customers report outages, and team members identify performance problems. Incidents are now a type of issue, so your team members can quickly create incidents through a familiar workflow. Click **New Issue** from anywhere within GitLab, and in the **Type** field, select **Incident**.
