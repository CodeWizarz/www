      description: |
        When Reviewing a Merge Request it is difficult to determine if the modified code is covered by a unit test or not. Reviewers may instead rely on the overall coverage value and require an increase in the value before they approve the Merge Request. This can lead to a scattershot approach of test writing by developers that may not actually improve code quality or coverage.

        Now a developer will see a visual representation of code coverage in the Merge Request diff when doing a review. This visual indicator makes it easy to see if the modified code is covered by a unit test or not, helping speed up code reviews and the time for a feature to be merged and deployed.

        Thank you to [Fabio Huser](https://gitlab.com/fh1ch) and Siemens for the contribution!
