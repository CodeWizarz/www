      description: |
        Compliance-minded organizations need a way to control SSH credential access to their GitLab environment. SSH keys are normally configured without expiration dates. This is problematic for organizations with access management and/or credential management policies, which require an expiration date on all access credentials. With this release, GitLab supports expiration dates for SSH keys that users can set within the GitLab UI.
