        [Auto Monitoring](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/autodevops/stages.html#auto-monitoring) is a feature of [Auto DevOps](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/autodevops/), a predefined CI/CD configuration allowing you to automatically detect, build, test, deploy, and monitor your applications.

        Auto Monitoring enables you to monitor your applicationâ€™s server and response metrics right out of the box after deploying your application. Auto Monitoring uses [Prometheus](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/prometheus.html) to display system metrics such as CPU and memory usage directly from [Kubernetes](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/prometheus_library/kubernetes.html), and response metrics such as HTTP error rates, latency, and throughput from the [NGINX Server](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/prometheus_library/nginx_ingress.html). While this sounds like a lot to configure, we've reduced the configuration required for you to see the metrics and alerting in action by adding out-of-the-box alerts for NGINX Throughput and HTTP error rate metrics that work right away after you set up Auto Monitoring for Auto DevOps.
