        Development leaders and GitLab administrators often wish to understand how their teams are using GitLab. In this MVC you'll see three counts on the group landing page: Merge Requests, Issues, and Users added to the group, all over the past 90 days. This feature is being released in [beta](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/gitlab-the-product/#beta).
