        Hosting static websites with GitLab Pages is an easy and quick way to get your site up and running. Editing the content that populates your static site, however, often requires setting up complex local development environments, an understanding of the underlying project architecture, and familiarity with Markdown syntax. For some, this is a barrier to collaboration.

        We're taking our first step toward delivering a first-class editing experience for static site content that facilitates collaboration on content without requiring any prior knowledge of programming languages or even Git. GitLab now includes a new project template that creates a static website, initially supporting Middleman, pre-configured to be hosted on GitLab Pages and with content that can be edited in a new, streamlined Static Site Editor. **After deploying** the site, just click the *"Edit this page"* link visible on every page and this will launch our new editor which removes the extraneous interface and focuses entirely on the content of the page. When you're done, one click generates a new branch and a merge request for your changes.
