      description: |
        When deploying to AWS, applying the necessary environment variables should be as convenient as possible. You can now select the predefined variables for 'AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID', 'AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY' and 'AWS_DEFAULT_REGION' from the environment variable key list. You'll also see the variables you enter validated to ensure they are entered in a valid format.
