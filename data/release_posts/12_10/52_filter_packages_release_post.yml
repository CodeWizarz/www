      GitLab's Package Registry enables you to store a myriad of package types in a single, universal, registry. Until recently, the only way to explore your list of packages was to change the sort order. This made it difficult to find a specific package efficiently, especially if you stored many packages within your registry.

      We are excited to announce that as of GitLab 12.10, you can now filter by `name` to find your packages quickly.
