        We're also releasing GitLab Runner 12.10 today! GitLab Runner is the lightweight, highly scalable, cross-platform software
        agent that runs your build jobs and sends the results back to a GitLab instance.
        GitLab Runner works in conjunction with GitLab CI/CD, the open-source continuous integration service included with GitLab.

        #### Fixed bugs:

        - Fix: [On occasion, a job fails, and the Runner generates a `no such file or directory` error](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/issues/1379).
        - Fix: [Docker machine fails to create autoscaled Runner instances on AWS when the Runner hostname includes an underscore (`_`)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/issues/3021).
        - Fix: [On occasion, jobs fail on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), and the Runner generates an `error dialing backend: EOF` error](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/issues/3247).
        - Fix: [Job failing with container name already in use error for Docker executor](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/issues/4327).
        - Fix: [Job failing with "No such container" error for Docker executor](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/issues/4450).
        - Fix: [Build container hostnames that include an underscore (`_`) are not RFC1035 compliant](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/issues/4779).
        - Fix: [Runner hostnames that include an underscore (`_`) are not RFC1035 compliant](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/issues/6325).
        - Fix: [A spelling error in the Helm chart configuration prevented the Runner from using a previously defined Google secret](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab-runner/-/issues/99).

        The list of all changes is in the GitLab Runner [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/blob/v12.10.0/CHANGELOG.md).
