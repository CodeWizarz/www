        Organizations using GitLab have company policies and industry regulations that dictate how they operate. A top-of-mind goal for many of our customers is ensuring their GitLab projects are adhering to internal company policies, which are influenced by industry regulations. Previously, there was no easy way to identify a project as one that has certain compliance requirements or additional oversight, which is a fundamental need to tracking compliance status.

        Now you can label projects with specific compliance frameworks by navigating to a project's `Settings` area and, in the `General` section, choosing from the `Compliance framework` dropdown menu. This feature lays a foundation to ease project compliance management in the future.
