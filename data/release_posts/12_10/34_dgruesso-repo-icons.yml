      description: |
        When viewing files in your repository, GitLab now displays an icon based
        on the file extension.
        Different file types use icons of different colors and shapes to help people
        quickly recognize files in the editor, and when browsing their computer.

        This change also makes icon styling consistent between the repository view,
        the Web IDE, and the merge request file tree. Enjoy!
