    Dmitry has made a major contribution adding the Puma web server to the GitLab `unicorn` Helm chart ([soon to be the `webservice` chart](#gitlab-chart-improvements)). This work provides users of the GitLab Helm chart with [the option to use Puma instead of Unicorn](#puma-will-become-the-default-application-server). In testing, we have observed a 40% reduction in memory usage when using Puma as the web server. Dmitry, we appreciate your awesome collaboration and enormous contribution to add Puma to our cloud native installation.

    Check out [the epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/charts/-/epics/11), and get started today! Thank you, Dmitry, for your contribution and hard work.
