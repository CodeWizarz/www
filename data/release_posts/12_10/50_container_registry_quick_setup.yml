    description: |
      The GitLab Container Registry used to show an illustration that contained easy to copy build and push commands with the correct registry URL for your project. However, once an image was added to the registry, the commands would disappear.

      In 12.10, we now show these Docker commands even when the registry is not empty. This will make the onboarding process of a new user easier and will boost their familiarity with Docker commands.
