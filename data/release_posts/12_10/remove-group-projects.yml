    description: |
      To improve performance, we limited the number of projects returned from the `groups/:id endpoint. Starting with [GitLab 12.9](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/31031), we limited the number of projects returned on the group details API to 100.

      To further improve performance of this endpoint, we are removing the 'projects' and 'shared projects' attributes from the response when requesting [details of a group](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/groups.html#details-of-a-group) via API, starting in GitLab 13.0. Users can still find this information in the same Group API, in the [list a group's projects](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/groups.html#list-a-groups-projects) endpoint.
