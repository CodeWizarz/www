  - feature_name: "Introducing a new 'id' field which will eventually replace 'cve' in the JSON common security report"

    description: |
      GitLab's current JSON common report format for security reports needs
      improvements, particularly as we encourage and add third-party security
      vendor integrations. The primary field `cve` property is confusing, as it
      does not contain CVE data, and should therefore be removed. We are introducing
      the `id` field, which is automatically calculated for GitLab scanners and
      is required for third-party partner scanners. The `id` field will eventually
      replace `cve` as a unique finding identifier. Anyone leveraging the `cve` property in
      security reports, with custom scripts or as an integrator into our Secure
      features, will eventually need to stop using the `cve` property and instead should
      start using the new `id` property. Please be aware that today `id` and `cve` are both required fields.
