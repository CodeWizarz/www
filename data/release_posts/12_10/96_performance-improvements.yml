        We are continuing to make great strides improving the performance of GitLab in every release. [We're committed](/handbook/product/gitlab-the-product/#performance) to not only making individual instances of GitLab even faster, but also to greatly improving the performance of GitLab.com, an instance that has over 1 million users!

        In GitLab 12.10 we are shipping performance improvements for issues, projects, milestones, and a lot more! Some of the improvements in GitLab 12.10 are:

        - [Milestone pages with large numbers of issues no longer time out](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/39453)
        - [Merge Requests Discussions API no longer degrades with comments count](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/32455)

        - [Make Rails.cache and Gitlab::Redis::Cache use the same pool](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/28074)
