      description: |
        While triaging an incident, charts help you visualize what went wrong, which can speed up investigation and resolution. In 12.9, GitLab started [automatically embedding relevant charts](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/119016) in all incident issues that were created from GitLab-configured Prometheus alerts. We have now extended this feature to work in issues generated from all Prometheus alerts GitLab receives, whether the alerts were configured in GitLab or configured externally.
