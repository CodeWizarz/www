      description: |
        Managing multiple epics across multiple groups and projects is difficult. To help users track projects and in-flight work GitLab
        now enables you to report on and quickly respond to the health of individual issues and epics by showing a red, amber, or green
         health status on your Epic Tree. Assign an issue a health status of **On track** (green), **Needs attention** (amber), or
         **At risk** (red) and see an aggregate report of health at the Epic level. Quickly view and analyze where a collection of work is
          at risk so you can open up the right discussions at the right time and keep work on track!
