      description: |
        Designs uploaded to Issues can be quite large in file size. Loading these files can take a long time, especially if you have more than one Design in an Issue. With this release, we now automatically generate Design thumbnails and use them to speed up the load time of the Design tab. This will also enable us to improve loading times of Designs in other parts of GitLab as we continue to build out the Design Management feature.

        We tested the GitLab homepage [mockup](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/uploads/8e5d9f965c05c6963f4fd3bb487458ec/test.png) which is 1222px by 5113px and was 2.6MB. With thumbnail generation, this image comes down to 0.018MB, which is a *~99.9% reduction in size!*
