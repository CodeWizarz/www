      description: |
        Release and build managers are often in charge of wrangling several activities outside of GitLab in order to effectively deliver a release. GitLab is working to make the Release page a single source of truth for everything regarding your releases. We've added the ability to link runbooks to the assets of a Release so you can now track all of these related activities easily and see how far along they are.
