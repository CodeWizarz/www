        It is now possible to set up a dependency relationship on a project you depend on, such that when the default branch on that project builds successfully, a pipeline on your default branch also triggers. This relationship is set up as a subscription from the project with the dependency, making it easy to set these up even in situations where the project you depend on is managed by another group.
