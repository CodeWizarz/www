      description: |
        The first step towards managing requirements from within GitLab is
        here! This initial release allows users to create and view
        requirements at a project level.

        We often hear about the struggles associated with external requirement
        management tools - difficult integrations, multiple toolchains, and
        challenging workflows. We believe in the power of a single application, by
        offering an opportunity to keep all requirements, designs, code, and
        tests in a single environment. As Requirements Management evolves in GitLab, stay tuned for support for
        traceability between all
        artifacts, creating a seamless workflow to visually demonstrate completeness and compliance.

        For more information and to collaborate with us on the amazing
        Requirements Management system, see [Requirements Management
        Category Direction](/direction/plan/certify/).
