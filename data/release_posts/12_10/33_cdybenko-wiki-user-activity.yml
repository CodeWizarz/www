      description: |
        Up to GitLab 12.9, when you contribute to the wiki content, it does not influence your activity in GitLab. With this release, you'll see all wiki contributions on the project, group, and user activity pages. Now you can track wiki changes and wiki editors will get credit for their contributions!
