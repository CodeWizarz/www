      description: |
        In 12.6, GitLab introduced a streamlined approach to collect all the necessary information to support compliance and audit efforts within the Release object. With this new feature, an evidence collection timestamp will appear alongside a link to download the evidence hash. This enables auditors to easily compare Release Evidence over time, rather than requiring a script to collect and compare each piece of evidence.
