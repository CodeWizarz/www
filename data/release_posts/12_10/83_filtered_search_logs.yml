        Logs, while ubiquitous, are only useful if the relevant logs can be found easily. In GitLab 12.10, we introduced filtered search for pod logs, enabling you to search and define filters for pod logs with a single, scalable search bar. This replaces the cumbersome combination of terminal view, filters, and a search bar, ultimately enabling you to find the relevant logs more easily.
