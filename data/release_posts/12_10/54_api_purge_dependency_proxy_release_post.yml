    description: |
      The GitLab Dependency Proxy allows you to proxy and cache images hosted on DockerHub so they are readily available for use within GitLab CI/CD. However, up until this release, there wasn't a way for you to purge the cache and that resulted in additional storage costs.

      This is no longer the case. Now, you can use the GitLab API for purging the cache of your group's Dependency Proxy and lower your total cost of storage.
