      description: |
        In this release, GitLab adds support for lightweight JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication to integrate with your existing HashiCorp Vault. Now, you can seamlessly provide secrets to CI/CD jobs by taking advantage of [HashiCorp's JWT authentication method](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/jwt/) rather than manually having to provide secrets as a variable in GitLab.
