    description: |
      In [gitlab#279039](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/279039), we added support for Deployment Frequency at the project level. This release extends support for this API to the group level. This allows users to get a full picture of the Deployment Frequency across projects and teams, so they can assess their efficiency more accurately.
