      In every release, we continue to make great strides in improving the overall effectiveness and usefulness of our product.

      We also started a [UI Polish gallery](https://nicolasdular.gitlab.io/gitlab-polish-gallery/?milestone=13.10) to track important updates to our interfaces. They are often small, but make your experience more enjoyable. 

      In GitLab 13.10, we're shipping usability improvements for issues, projects, milestones, and much more! Some highlights in GitLab 13.10 are:

      - [Increase contrast of Solarized Light in the Web IDE](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/322782).
      - [Disable commit button in Web IDE for users who don't have permission to commit](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/213581).
      - [Improve messaging and visual design when a Markdown quick action fails](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/287686).
