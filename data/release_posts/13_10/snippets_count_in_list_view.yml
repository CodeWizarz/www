    description: |
      GitLab 13.5 introduced the ability to create snippets that contain multiple files. However, there was no way for you to identify these multi-file snippets in the list view. You needed to open each snippet to distinguish between similarly-named snippets or to infer the type of data included by how many associated files it contains.  

      Now, the number of files contained in each snippet is displayed in the list view so you have access to this information before opening it.
