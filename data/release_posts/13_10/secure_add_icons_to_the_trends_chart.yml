    description: |
      In 13.6, we released a new Project Security Dashboard with a vulnerability trends chart. This chart provides a historical view of vulnerability counts by severity over the past 365 days. It provides valuable insights into a Project's security health trends.

      We've enhanced the chart to include new interactive elements to make it more effective and efficient to use. You can now zoom in on a selected section of the chart, and zoom out to the default view. You can also export an SVG image of the chart for use in external documents.
