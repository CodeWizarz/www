    description: |
     Previously, when [Merge when pipeline succeeds (MWPS)](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/merge_when_pipeline_succeeds.html) was set to on, all participating users within the merge request got a notification about this event. With GitLab 13.10, you can now choose to unsubscribe from the MWPS notification events with a new custom setting, allowing you to reduce unnecessary noise. Thanks to Ravishankar Gnanaprakasam for a great community contribution!
