      In every release, we continue to make great strides improving GitLab's performance. We're committed to making every GitLab instance faster. This includes GitLab.com, an instance with over 1 million registered users!

      In GitLab 13.10, we're shipping performance improvements for issues, projects, milestones, and much more! Some improvements in GitLab 13.10 are:

      - [Set up Shard Elasticsearch sorted set queues in Redis to reduce load on Redis](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/244865).
      - [Cache the Advanced Search counts request in browser](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/300150).
      - [Improve performance of the "Run pipeline" page for projects with many branches or tags](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/55394)
      - [Load epic issue metadata info in batches](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/322013)
