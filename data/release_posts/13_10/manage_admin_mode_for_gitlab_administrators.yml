    description: |
      GitLab now includes Admin Mode, which helps admins work safely from one account. When Admin Mode is not active, admins have the same privileges as a regular user. Before running administrative commands, admin users must reverify their credentials. Admin mode increases instance security by protecting sensitive operations and data. This feature is available behind feature flag `:user_mode_in_session`.
