    description: |
      When using the Visual Studio Code IDE (VS Code) you may need to work on a code repository that you don't have on your local machine. Before, cloning a project required several steps away from your editor: find the project in GitLab, copy its clone link, clone it into your local machine, and finally open it in VS Code.
      
      With the [GitLab Workflow](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitLab.gitlab-workflow) extension you can now use the `Git: Clone` command in VS Code to do all of that without leaving your editor. Use this command to search for projects in GitLab and clone them so you can quickly begin contributing.

      Thanks [Felix Haase](https://gitlab.com/haasef) for the contribution!
