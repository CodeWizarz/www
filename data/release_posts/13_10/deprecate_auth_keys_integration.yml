  description: |
    Currently, GitLab has three different mechanisms by which it can
    look up the user attached to an SSH key when signing in. Those are:

    1. Integration via `authorized_keys`
    1. [Fast lookup of SSH keys](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/operations/fast_ssh_key_lookup)
    1. [Lookup via SSH certificate](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/operations/ssh_certificates.html)

    The first mechanism (integration via `authorized keys`) is vulnerable to both race conditions and 
    out-of-order execution issues, making it hard to scale. Because of this it will be removed in
    GitLab 14.0. Refer to [issue #212227](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/212227) for details.
