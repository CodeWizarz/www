    description: |
      Setting the default description template for issues and merge requests can be valuable to ensure users provide the right content when creating these items. When you have many projects configuring each of these templates or updating them across all your projects, the process can be manual, error-prone, and time-consuming.

      With the new `issues_template` and `merge_requests_template` attributes available for the [projects API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/projects.html#templates-for-issues-and-merge-requests), you can automate setting and keeping these templates up-to-date for all of your projects.
