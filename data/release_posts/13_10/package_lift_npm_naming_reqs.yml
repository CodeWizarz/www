        When publishing npm packages to your project's Package Registry, you previously had to name your package with `@scope/package-name` so that the scope was an exact match to the root workspace of your project, including the case. For example, if your project path was `/Acme/project_a`, when you published a package, it had to have `Acme` as the scope.

        For many of you, this meant using a capital letter. However, the [public npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/) does not allow capital letters in the scope. So, you were forced to either change your group name, which might have had [unintended side effects](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/index.html#redirects-when-changing-repository-paths), or you might have chosen to not use the GitLab Package Registry.

        Moving forward, we will no longer enforce this naming convention for the project-level endpoint. Huzzah! Now you can name your packages and scope whatever you want.

        It's worth noting that using the instance-level endpoint will still require you to use the exact (case-sensitive) root of your namespace as the `@scope`.
