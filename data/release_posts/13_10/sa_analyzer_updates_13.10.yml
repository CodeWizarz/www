      If you are [including the GitLab managed vendored SAST template](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#configure-sast-in-your-cicd-yaml) ([SAST.gitlab-ci.yml](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml)) you do not need to do anything to receive these updates. However, if you override or customize your own CI template, you will need to update your CI configurations.
