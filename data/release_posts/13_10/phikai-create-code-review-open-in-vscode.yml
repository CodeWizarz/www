    description: |
      When working on a project for the first time, you often clone that project locally to start contributing via your local editor. This process involves a few steps: initially getting the path for cloning, finding a place on your system to clone the project, and then opening that project inside your editor of choice.

      When clicking the **Clone** dropdown for a project, you can now choose to open the project in Visual Studio Code (VS Code). Cloning is now a one-click experience: clone the project and then immediately start work in VS Code.
