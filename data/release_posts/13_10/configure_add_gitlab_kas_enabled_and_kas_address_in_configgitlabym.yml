    description: |
      While GitLab administrators could install the Kubernetes Agent Server along with their GitLab instance, until now they lacked many configuration options. With this release, GitLab administrators can specify the Agent Server's external and internal URLs as well as their operational status (enabled or disabled) in the core GitLab configuration file (`config/gitlab.yaml`). GitLab will use these configuration values for every interaction with the Agent Server.

      The Kubernetes Agent Server is also now available on GitLab.com. We are [progressively making this feature available](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/300960) to more projects over time.
