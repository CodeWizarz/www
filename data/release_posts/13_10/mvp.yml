    [Admin Mode](#admin-mode-re-authenticate-for-gitlab-administration) wouldn't have happened without a heroic, ongoing effort from Diego Louzán. This feature has been in the making for a year! With this feature, GitLab administrators can use their account without administrator entitlements unless they re-authenticate to trigger admin mode. This provides an additional level of protection to administrative operations and will be really useful in regulated industries. On behalf of administrators everywhere and all the sleepless nights we'll avoid, we tip our hats to you!

    Diego submitted [a complete package](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2158), and patiently addressed everyone's concerns -- and ideas "above and beyond" what was absolutely necessary. Diego collaborated extremely well with reviewers & maintainers on what was a big change - involving backend, frontend, database, and documentation. Admin Mode is feature flagged until 13.11, but since he completed the project during 13.10, we wanted to recognize Diego right away!
