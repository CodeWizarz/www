    description: |
      Previously, if you wanted to reference the exact date and time when a job started
      or a pipeline was created, you needed to retrieve these timestamps in your scripts.
      Now they are readily available as predefined CI/CD variables by using `CI_JOB_STARTED_AT` and
      `CI_PIPELINE_CREATED_AT`, provided in the ISO 8601 format and UTC time zone.
