  description: |
    Our CI/CD templates will be updated so that they no longer use hard-coded references to a `master` branch. In 14.0, they will all be changed to use a [CI/CD variable](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/predefined_variables.html) that points to your project's configured default branch instead. If your CI/CD pipeline relies on our built-in templates, you may want to verify that this change will work with your current configuration. For example, if you have a master branch and a different default branch, the updates to the templates may cause changes to your pipeline behavior.
