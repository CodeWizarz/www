    description: |
      It is currently possible to select and dismiss multiple vulnerabilities in bulk from a Vulnerability Report. This is helpful in quickly removing redundant occurrences or false positives. However, you must still open up individual vulnerability details to change status to anything other than Dismissed. This is inefficient for doing routine activities such as resolving all vulnerabilities no longer detected by securing scanners.

      This bulk actions enhancement addresses this limitation. Selecting one or more vulnerabilities from a Vulnerability Report will now present the option to set any status. You can even move vulnerabilities back to Detected if they need further triage evaluation. Combined with the filtering capabilities, it is easier than ever to isolate and take action on a specific subset of vulnerabilities all at once.
