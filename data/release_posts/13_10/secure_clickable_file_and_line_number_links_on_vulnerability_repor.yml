    description: |
      Many of GitLab's security scanners output a file and line number where a potential vulnerability is detected. Users can see this information in the form of a clickable link when viewing a vulnerability's details. The link will take the user directly to the file and line number inside the repository for the default branch. This same information is also displayed on the Vulnerability Report. However, the file names were not clickable, requiring that you open a vulnerability's details page to access the link.

      This enhancement brings the convenience of linked filenames to the Vulnerability Report. From a Project, Group, or [Security Center](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/security_dashboard/#security-center) Vulnerability Report, you can go directly to the affected file and line number from any vulnerability reported from a scanner that outputs this information. Because you no longer need to first open each vulnerability record, it is much faster to do things like open multiple referenced lines of code in separate tabs for speedy triage.
