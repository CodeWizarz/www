      It's not common for GitLab users to use their full name as their username. This makes it difficult to find the individuals you want to `@` mention because the autocomplete doesn't do a great job matching both full name or username. As a first step towards [making autocomplete smarter](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/207134), you can now more easily search for people based on their username or full name.
