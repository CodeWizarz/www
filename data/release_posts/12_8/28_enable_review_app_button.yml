      description: |
        We want to make Review Apps easy to set up even if you already have a functioning `.gitlab-ci.yml` file. A new **Enable Review Apps** button has been added to the environments page; if you are using Kubernetes and want to enable Review Apps, this will show you the YAML snippet that needs to be added to your `.gitlab-ci.yml`.
