    description: |
      To take advantage of improved performance and functionality in PostgreSQL 11, such as [partitioning](https://www.2ndquadrant.com/en/blog/partitioning-evolution-postgresql-11/), we plan to require [PostgreSQL 11](https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/1894/) in GitLab 13.0. To prepare for this, [PostgreSQL 11 is now supported and available in Omnibus GitLab 12.8](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/02/22/gitlab-12-8-released/#postgresql-11-is-now-available-in-omnibus-gitlab). While PostgreSQL 9.6 and 10.x are still supported and bundled in Omnibus GitLab, they will be removed in GitLab 13.0.

      By requiring a minimum version of PostgreSQL 11, we can use its new features without the overhead of maintaining multiple code paths. Going forward, we will maintain a yearly cadence of PostgreSQL upgrades, with the minimum required version of PostgreSQL being no more than two versions behind the latest. We welcome your feedback on the proposed removals in the [Move to PostgreSQL 11 and 12](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2184) epic.
