      description: |
        Accessibility of web pages and applications is a growing concern for software developers today. Unfortunately, accessibility testing is often an afterthought occurring late in the software development process. It's typically a manual and inconsistent process if it's done at all. Development teams often lack clear requirements from Product Managers or Product Designers outlining accessibility standards to follow when building an application.

        Starting in GitLab 12.8, you will be able to automatically scan and get a report of accessibility issues in your Review App. This saves development time by bringing the feedback loop of accessibility issues much closer, so you can have the most impact on making the application accessible for all users. As a first step, you can download a report for every Merge Request.

        We see this as a solid foundation to build on in the accessibility testing category. We are looking forward to feedback from customers on our Accessibility Testing category vision.
