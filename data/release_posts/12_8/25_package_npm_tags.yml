      description: |
        To verify that their NPM package was uploaded or to look up the correct version of a package, users would like to use package metadata. NPM tags can be used to provide an alias instead of version numbers, making it easier to discover packages. For example, a project might choose to have multiple streams of development and use a different tag for each stream, such as `stable`, `beta`, `dev`, or `canary`.

        In GitLab 12.8, we are excited to announce that we now support NPM distribution tags in the GitLab NPM Registry. You can now add, remove, and list tags associated with any package hosted in their registry, making it both faster and easier to find and discover packages.
