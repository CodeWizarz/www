      description: |
        Specifying an empty `needs:` array can be used to indicate to GitLab that there is no predecessor for that job and that it can always start immediately, regardless of what stage it is in. You can use this to set up more flexible relationships in a DAG pipeline, speeding them up and making them more efficient.
