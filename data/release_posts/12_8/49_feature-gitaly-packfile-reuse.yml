        In GitLab 12.8, we are including a patched version of Git 2.24 in GitLab Omnibus with improvements to Git packfile reuse.

        When a client fetches or clones, it is more efficient for the server to respond by reusing existing packfiles as much as possible. The improvements implement a new smarter algorithm for reusing packfiles that makes a better compromise between the cost to serve a clone or a fetch, and the quality of the resulting packfile.

        Thank you [Peff](https://github.com/peff/) and GitHub for sharing this improvement, and Jonathan Tan (Google) for your help reviewing! We hope the [patches](https://public-inbox.org/git/20191218112547.4974-1-chriscool@tuxfamily.org/) land in Git 2.26.
