      description: |
        When viewing a design inside the **Design** tab of an issue, you can drop comment badges on any area of the image and attach a comment. This is great for having point-of-interest discussions. However, as feedback is given and you upload new revisions, sometimes you need to move the badge to a new spot. This release lets you drag badges around. Now you can:

        - Drag the comment badge around after you drop it.
        - Move someone elseâ€™s badge over to fit yours.
        - Move the badges to match a new Design after you make a layout revision.
