      description: |
        We've re-enabled support for Git protocol v2 over HTTP. It was previously announced in GitLab 11.4, but was disabled due to a security issue in Git versions before Git 2.21.

        Developers fetch refs many times a day to check if the current branch is behind the remote branch. Git protocol v2 is a major update to Git's [wire protocol](https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/technical/pack-protocol.html) which defines how clones, fetches, and pushes are communicated between the client (your computer) and the server (GitLab). The new wire protocol improves the performance of fetch commands and enables future protocol improvements.

        Previously, all responses to fetch commands included a list of all references in the repository. For example, fetching updates for a single branch (e.g. `git fetch origin master`) would also retrieve a complete list of all references. In the case of large projects, this could be over 100,000 refs and tens of megabytes of data.

        Git protocol v2 is supported from Git 2.18.0 and is opt-in. To enable it, run `git config --global protocol.version 2`. Git protocol v2 over SSH is not yet enabled. Follow this [issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-shell/issues/273) for updates.
