      description: |
        Every commit in a Git repository has an author, but this is not verified by Git and means that it is easy to create commits that appear to be authored by someone else. Commit signing allows you to prove that you are the author of the commit. This is important for sensitive projects and in some commercial environments.

        In Git 2.19, OpenGPG signing and verification support was extended to include support for S/MIME using X.509 certificates, because managing these certificates is more friendly for large organizations.

        GitLab now also supports S/MIME Signature Verification of commits, thanks to [Roger Meier](https://gitlab.com/bufferoverflow) from Siemens! Further thanks go to [Henning Schild](https://gitlab.com/henning-schild), also from Siemens, for [contributing this feature to Git](https://public-inbox.org/git/20180706011834.GD7697@genre.crustytoothpaste.net/) in the first place!
