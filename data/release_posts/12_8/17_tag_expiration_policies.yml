      description: |
        You build many Docker images as part of your pipelines, however, many of these images are only needed for a short time. Until now, you've had to rely on removing images via the [Container Registry API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/container_registry.html) or using the user interface. Both require effort. Wouldn't it be great to define a policy and have those unwanted tags removed automatically?

        In 12.8, we are excited to introduce Docker tag expiration policies for all new projects. This new feature allows you to identify a tag by name, select how many versions of the tag to keep, and define when it should be removed. For example, you can set up a policy that will remove all tag names that match a regex like the Git SHA, always keep at least five images, and remove any image that is older than 30 days.
