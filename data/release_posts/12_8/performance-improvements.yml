        We are continuing to make great strides improving the performance of GitLab in every release. [We're committed](/handbook/product/gitlab-the-product/#performance) to not only making individual instances of GitLab even faster, but also to greatly improving the performance of GitLab.com, an instance that has over 1 million users!

        In GitLab 12.8 we are shipping performance improvements for issues, projects, milestones, and a lot more! Some of the improvements in GitLab 12.8 are:
