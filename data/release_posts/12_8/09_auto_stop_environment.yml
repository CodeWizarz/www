      description: |
        You can now set the expiration time to stop environments automatically after a certain idle period. This is especially useful for short-lived environments (such as the ones used for Review Apps) to avoid wasting resources. It can be set up through a new entry in `.gitlab-ci.yml`, for example, `auto_stop_in: 1 week`, and can be manually overridden from the GitLab UI. Users can also disable auto-stop by pinning their particular environment through the UI and keeping the environment running regardless of the setting.

        By preventing a situation where many stale environments are laying around, you donâ€™t waste infrastructure resources by keeping them running. You also gain back development time that would otherwise be spent manually stopping environments.
