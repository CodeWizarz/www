      Our UX team found that the terminology we used for Severity and Confidence was similar but not the same, which resulted in a lot of confusion. You can read more about that work in the epic [Security reports: Remodel severity and confidence](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2228). In Secure, we will be deprecating the use of `undefined` for both Severity and Confidence properties in Security Reports (JSON) and the vulnerabilities API.

      If you are searching for or expecting `undefined` as a filter value in the [vulnerability API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/vulnerability_findings.html), you can instead use `unknown`.
