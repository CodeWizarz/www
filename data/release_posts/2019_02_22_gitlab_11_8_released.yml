        Static Application Security Testing (SAST) allows you to spot vulnerabilities
        in your source code every time you commit a new change to the repository.
        With this information available in the merge request, you can shift security left
        and address problems even before they are merged into the stable branch.

        With 11.8, we add JavaScript to the list of languages supported by SAST.
        You donâ€™t need to change anything in your pipelines. JavaScript projects are
        automatically detected and analyzed for security vulnerabilities. It is also
        part of [Auto DevOps](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/autodevops/#auto-sast).

        Keeping an eye on errors generated by your application helps maintain a good user experience
        by detecting problems before users report them and speeding up resolution when they occur.

        GitLab 11.8 makes it more convenient and efficient to monitor errors by integrating with
        popular open source error tracker Sentry, and displaying the most recent errors right within your GitLab project.

        Sentry has recently [improved their GitLab integration](/blog/2019/01/25/sentry-integration-blog-post/),
        enabling detection of suspicious commits, release and commit tracking, and more. With the combination of both integrations
        you'll have a simple path to Sentry from GitLab, as well as a clean way to get to GitLab from Sentry, so that
        you can always address errors contextually, staying within your existing workflow.

        set up in this way will have a URL in the format of
        `toplevel-group.gitlab.io/subgroup/project`. This will give your
        projects, even when part of subgroups, access to the ability to

      description: |
        Code review is an essential practice of every successful project, but
        who should review the changes is not always clear. It is frequently
        desirable to have a variety of reviewers from different teams like
        Engineering, UX, and Product.

        Approval Rules, new in GitLab 11.8, allow you to better communicate who
        should participate in code reviews by specifying the eligible
        approvers and the minimum number of approvals for each. Approval rules
        are shown in the merge request widget so the next reviewer can quickly
        be assigned.

        In GitLab 11.3 we introduced
        [Code Owners](/releases/2018/09/22/gitlab-11-3-released/#code-owners)
        to indicate which team members are responsible for which code in your
        project. Code owners are integrated into approval rules so that finding
        the right people to review your change is always easy.

        Approval Rules are disabled by default in 11.8 and must be enabled by
        an instance administrator by executing
        `Feature.enable(:approval_rules)` in the rails console.

        Approval Rules have temporarily been disabled on GitLab.com. We expect
        to be re-enabled after deploying GitLab 11.8.1. Follow
        [this issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/9913)
        for updates.

        Starting with [GitLab 9.3](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2017/06/22/gitlab-9-3-released/#multi-project-pipeline-graphs), you've been able to create [multi-project pipelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/multi_project_pipelines.html)
        by triggering a downstream pipeline via a GitLab API call in your job. In 11.8, we've added first-class support for triggering
        these downstream pipelines with the `trigger:` keyword, which can be added to a bridge job to automatically trigger a downstream pipeline when the current pipeline succeeds.

      description: |
        Creating Git history that is readable and useful to people in the
        future can be at odds with pushing small commits to fix a unit test
        or resolve feedback. Commit squashing combines all these commits into
        a single tidy change, but at the same time wipes out your thoughtful
        commit messages.

        GitLab now defaults the squash commit message to the first multi-line
        commit message in the feature branch, and allows you to override the
        commit message so that you can update it to reflect any important
        changes.

        Auto DevOps allows you to quickly get started by adding a "base domain" for your projects.
        When your application is ready for production deployment, you may then want to use a
        custom, fully qualified domain name.

        You can now use the environment variable `ADDITIONAL_HOSTS` to specify one or more custom
        domains for your application. Furthermore, you can scope it to a specific environment
        by prepending the environment name to the variable, ie. `<ENVIRONMENT>_ADDITIONAL_HOSTS`.

        You can now see the scale of your serverless deployments for each application or function
        deployed to your Knative instance. Scale is illustrated by the number of Kubernetes
        pods currently in use.

        When you first load the roadmap view, GitLab preselects a time period for you,
        with options to select weekly, monthly, or quarterly intervals. But the
        view was fixed, and epics outside of what was displayed were hidden.


        With this release, you can now scroll forward into the future and backward
        into the past. Epics that fall in these expanded times will automatically
        appear in the view, without requiring you to refresh the page in any way,
        allowing you a seamless experience to see even more epics in as long of a
        timeline you need.

        authentication [added in 11.6](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/726) by
        allowing credentials on a smart card to be authorized against a configured LDAP server.

        GitLab's approach follows [RFC4523](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4523) schema standards
        using the `certificateExactMatch` rule.

      description: |
        It is now possible to individually turn feature flags on or off on a per-environment
        basis. The behavior of your feature flags is controlled by creating a set of rules based
        on matching the environment name. There is always a default wildcard rule (`*`), but you are also able to add
        more rules by adding more environment specs (for example, `review/*`).

        In 11.8.0 this feature will require enabling the feature flag, by executing
        `Feature.enable(:feature_flags_environment_scope)` in the rails console.

        Kubernetes provides an exciting opportunity to disconnect the underlining hardware from where our workloads run. However, some tasks require specialized hardware â€“ including jobs that may require more resources than others.

        Kubernetes supports this by introducing [taint and toleration](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/taint-and-toleration/) to nodes in order to include these considerations when scheduling pods. We've added native support for taints and tolerations in the Kubernetes executor in GitLab Runner to support these types of workflows.

        In GitLab 11.3 support for [setting alerts was introduced](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2018/09/22/gitlab-11-3-released/#alerts-for-library-metrics), however it was limited to Prometheus instances
        which were deployed through the GitLab [Kubernetes integration](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/clusters/#installing-applications).

        With GitLab 11.8, manually configured Prometheus servers can now also notify GitLab of alerts, by simply adding GitLab as a webhook receiver in alertmanager.
        After receiving an alert, GitLab will email Maintainers and Owners of the project.

This version also includes [security updates](http://about.mattermost.com/security-updates/) and upgrading is recommended.
        - `node_exporter` no longer runs by default in the Omnibus docker image, as it requires access to the host.
        - Additional alerts have been added, notifying administrators about: high unicorn utilization, sidekiq job queues, postgres deadlocks, high error rates, and more.
        - `nginx` has been updated to 1.12.2, `registry` to 2.7.1, and `gitlab-elasticsearch-indexer` to 1.0.0.

      Since GitLab versions prior to [11.7](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/22) rely on these APIs for Google OAuth2,
      Google single sign-on will no longer function on these versions. GitLab
      [11.7](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/milestones/22) and beyond [will support Google SSO](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/55668).

      Storage is enabled and all projects are migrated:
      [gitlab-ee#8289](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/8289). If
