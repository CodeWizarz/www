    description: |
      Some projects use multiple long-term branches for development, like `develop` and `qa`. In these projects, you might want to keep `main` as the default branch since it represents the production state of the project. However, development work expects merge requests to target `develop` or `qa`. Target branch rules help ensure merge requests target the appropriate branch for your project and development workflow.
      
      When you create a merge request, the rule checks the name of the branch. If the branch name matches the rule, the merge request pre-selects the branch you specified in the rule as the target. If the branch name does not match, the merge request targets the default branch of the project.
