  - title: "Welcome page removed from GitLab self-managed"
    description: From GitLab 16.5, users who complete the registration process for a self-managed instance are not shown the welcome page. Instead, newly registered users are sent to `dashboard/projects`, the activity page for the entity the user was invited to, or the location the user was trying to reach before registration. For more information, see [issue 411858](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/411858).
