        - GitLab 16.5 `.deb` Linux packages have [switched from gzip to xz compression](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/-/issues/8197),
          resulting in smaller package sizes. This change might result in slower unpacking times during installation.
        - GitLab 16.5 includes [Mattermost 9.0](https://docs.mattermost.com/install/self-managed-changelog.html#release-v9-0-major-release).
          This version removes the deprecated Insights feature, and
          [Mattermost Boards and various plugins have transitioned to community support](https://forum.mattermost.com/t/upcoming-product-changes-to-boards-and-various-plugins/16669).
        - GitLab 16.5 [moves the GitLab SELinux policy module](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/-/merge_requests/7165) 
          from `/opt/gitlab/embedded/selinux/rhel/7/` to `/opt/gitlab/embedded/selinux` to reflect that the module isn't only for RHEL 7.
