    description: |
      With this release, you can link [tasks](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/tasks.html#linked-items-in-tasks) and [OKRs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/okrs.html#linked-items-in-okrs) as "related," "blocked by," or "blocking" to provide traceability between dependent and related work items.

      When we migrate [epics](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9290) and [issues](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9584) to the work item framework, you will be able to link across all these types.
