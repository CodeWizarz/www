    description: |
      Previously, you had to delete HTTP headers added to audit event streaming destinations, even if you only wanted to deactivate
      them temporarily.

      With GitLab 16.5, you can use the **Active** checkbox in the GitLab UI to toggle each header on and off individually. You can use this to:

      - Test different headers.
      - Temporarily deactivate a header.
      - Switch between two versions of the same header.
