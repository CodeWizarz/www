    description: |
      The permissions to manage group members and project access tokens have been added to the custom roles framework. You can add these permissions to any base role to create a custom role. By creating custom roles with only the permissions needed to accomplish a particular set of tasks, you do not have to unnecessarily assign highly privileged roles such as Maintainer and Owner to users.
