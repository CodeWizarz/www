    description: |
      Administrators can now configure a locked user policy for their instance by choosing the number of unsuccessful sign-in attempts, and how long the user is locked for. For example, five unsuccessful sign-in attempts would lock a user for 60 minutes. This allows administrators to define a locked user policy that meets their security and compliance needs. Previously, the number of sign-in attempts and locked user time period were not configurable.
