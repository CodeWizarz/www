    description: |
       You can now trigger bulk resync or reverify for any data component managed by Geo, through buttons in the Geo admin UI. Selecting the button will apply the operation to all data items related to the respective component. Before, this was only possible by logging into the Rails console. These actions are now more accessible, and the experience of troubleshooting and applying large scale changes that require a full resync or reverify of specific components, such as moving storage locations, is improved.
