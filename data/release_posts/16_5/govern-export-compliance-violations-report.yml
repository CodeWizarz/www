    description: |
      The compliance violations report can contain a lot of information. Previously, you could only view the information in the GitLab UI. This was fine for individual issues, but
      could be tricky if you needed to, for example:

      - Create an artifact of the current compliance status for a release. For example, prove to an auditor that there were 0 violations.
      - Aggregate the data with another data set or process it in another tool.

      In GitLab 16.5, you can now export a list of the items included in the compliance violations report in CSV format.
