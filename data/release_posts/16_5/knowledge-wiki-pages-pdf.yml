    description: From GitLab 16.5, you can export individual wiki pages as PDF files. Now, sharing team knowledge is even more seamless. Exporting a wiki to PDF can be used for a variety of use cases. For example, to provide a copy of technical documentation that is kept in a wiki or share information in a wiki with project status. Gone is the need to leverage alternative tools to convert Markdown files to PDF, since in some organizations, using these tools is prohibited, creating another challenge. Thank you to JiHu for contributing this feature!
