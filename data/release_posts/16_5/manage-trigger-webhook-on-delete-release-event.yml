    description: |
      You can use release events to monitor release objects and react to changes. Previously, a webhook was only triggered when a release was created or updated. In heavily regulated industries, deleting releases is a crucial event that must be monitored and followed up.
      With GitLab 16.5, a webhook is now also triggered when a release is deleted.
