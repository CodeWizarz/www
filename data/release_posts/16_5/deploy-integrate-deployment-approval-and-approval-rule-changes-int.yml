    description: |
      Deployments in regulated industries are a central topic of compliance. In previous releases, deployment approvals were not part of audited events, which made it difficult to tell when and how approval rules changed.

      GitLab now ships with a new set of audit events for deployment approval and approval rule changes. These events fire when deployment approval rules change, or when approval rules for protected environments change.
