    description: |
      You can now use a new REST API endpoint at `user/personal_access_tokens` to create a new personal access token for the currently authenticated user. This token's scope is limited to `k8s_proxy` for security reasons, so you can use it to only perform Kubernetes API calls using the agent for Kubernetes. Previously, only instance administrators could [create personal access tokens through the API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/users.html#create-a-personal-access-token).
