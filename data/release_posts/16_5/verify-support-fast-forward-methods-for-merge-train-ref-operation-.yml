      description: |
        In 16.4, we released [Fast-forward merge trains](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2023/09/22/gitlab-16-4-released/#fast-forward-merge-support-for-merge-trains), and as a continuation, we want to ensure we support all [merge methods](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/methods/). Now, if you want to ensure your semi-linear commit history is maintained you can use semi-linear fast-forward merge trains.
