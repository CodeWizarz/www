      Geo has changed the workflow for proxying SSH Git pull requests. Pull requests made against a secondary site are now proxied via the [GitLab shell](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/gitlab_shell/) (instead of [Workhorse](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/workhorse/)) to the primary site. This is a behind-the-scenes change. No action is needed on your part.
