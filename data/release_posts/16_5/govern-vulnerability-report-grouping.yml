    description: |
      As a user, you require the ability to group vulnerabilities so that you can more efficiently triage vulnerabilities. With this release, you are able to group by severity or status. This will help you better answer questions like how many confirmed vulnerabilities are in a group or project, or how many vulnerabilities still need to be triaged.
