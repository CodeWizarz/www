  - title: "GitLab releases are moving to the third Thursday of the month"
    description: |
      Starting with GitLab 16.6, which will be released on Nov. 16, 2023, **our monthly release date will change from the 22nd of every month to the third Thursday of every month**. This iteration in our release processes will ensure consistency and create more predictability for our customers in terms of the day of the week for the release while continuing our monthly pace of self-managed releases.

      Please see more information in our [blog post](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2023/09/18/gitlab-release-date-change/).
  - title: "GitLab is putting a 100MiB per file limit on pushes to projects on the Free tier of GitLab.com SaaS"
    description: |
      Since Git is not designed to handle large files well, GitLab is putting in place a 100MiB per file
      limit on pushes to projects that are on the Free tier of GitLab.com SaaS. We believe this limit will improve the
      health of our Git systems on GitLab.com, leading to better performance across the board.

      More information can be found in the [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/free_push_limit.html).

      We welcome any [feedback](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/428188) about this new limit.
