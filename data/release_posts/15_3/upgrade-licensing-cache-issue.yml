      GitLab versions 15.3.0 - 15.3.4 were affected by a [licensing cache issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/376706) which meant some premium features of GitLab will stop working if you add a new license.
      Workarounds for this issue include:
      - Restarting all Rails, Sidekiq, and Gitaly nodes after applying a new license. This clears the relevant license caches and allows all premium features to operate correctly.
      - Upgrading to a version that is not impacted by this issue, for example 15.3.5.
