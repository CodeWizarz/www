    - name: Web IDE is now open source
      available_in: [core, starter, premium, ultimate]
      documentation_link: 'https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/web_ide/'
      documentation_text: "Read through the documentation on the Web IDE"

      description: |
        The new Web IDE makes it faster and easier to contribute small fixes
        and resolve merge request feedback by eliminating the need to stash
        changes and switch branches locally.

        Using the Web IDE, you can change multiple files, preview Markdown,
        review the changes and commit directly from the browser. The Web IDE
        can be opened when browsing the repository, viewing a file, and
        directly from merge requests so that you can quickly resolve feedback
        or contribute a change while doing a code review. If you open a merge
        request in the Web IDE you can also preview the merge request diff
        before committing, which allows you to review the entire scope of the
        merge request directly in the Web IDE!

        Introduced in [GitLab Ultimate 10.4](/releases/2018/01/22/gitlab-10-4-released/#web-ide-editor-beta)
        the Web IDE is now Generally Available (GA).
        We decided to make Web IDE open source, because we believe building something so complex
        and personal as an IDE is only possible together. Plus, this lowers the bar for anyone to
        contribute to their favorite projects.

# PRIMARY FEATURES
  primary:
    - name: Deploy Tokens
      available_in: [core, starter, premium, ultimate]
      documentation_link: 'https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/deploy_tokens/'
      documentation_text: "Read through the documentation on Deploy Tokens"
      image_url: '/images/10_7/deploy_tokens.png'
      reporter: bikebilly
      issue_url: 'https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/31591'
      description: |
        Projects may need to provide long lived read-only access to the repository
        or to the Docker images uploaded to the GitLab Container Registry.
        Previously this required using Personal Access Tokens (PAT), but these are
        associated to a specific user account and also share their access.

        Deploy Tokens, available in GitLab 10.7, solve this need by providing
        a permanent token that is tied to the specific project. Users
        can define if they want to enable repository or container registry
        access, revoke the token, or set an expiration date.

    - name: Variables support in 'only' and 'except' keywords
      available_in: [core, starter, premium, ultimate]
      documentation_link: 'https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/#variables-expressions'
      documentation_text: "Read through the documentation on variables support"
      image_url: '/images/10_7/variables_expressions.png'
      reporter: bikebilly
      issue_url: 'https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/37397'
      description: |
        GitLab CI/CD configuration allows you to define conditions to run
        a specific job, using the `only` and `except` keywords. For example, if
        you want a deploy job to run only on the `master` branch.

        In GitLab 10.7, we have expanded the syntax to allow variable expressions
        that can be used to define conditional jobs based on the existence
        or value of a specific environment variable. For example, you
        may now define which jobs you want to run just by tuning project
        variables, or you can restrict a job to be scheduled only when the
        `GITLAB_USER_NAME` variable is equal to a specific user.

    - name: SAST for Go and C/C++
      available_in: [ultimate]
      documentation_link: 'https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#supported-languages-and-frameworks'

      issue_2: 'https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/4124'
      description: |
        Static Application Security Testing is effective only in the event that your
        project is using a programming language supported by one of the
        tools integrated in GitLab. That is why we are increasing their number
        with each release, adding the most commonly used languages.

        In GitLab 10.7, projects written in Go and C/C++ can be automatically
        checked for security vulnerabilities. No need to specify the language,
        it will be autodetected at runtime for an easy user experience.

# SECONDARY FEATURES
  secondary:
    - name: Comments in epics
      available_in: [ultimate]
      documentation_link: 'https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/epics/'
      documentation_text: "Read through the documentation on Epics"
      image_url: '/images/10_7/epic-comment-thread.png'
      reporter: victorwu
      issue_url: 'https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/3889'
      description: |
        With this release, we continue to iterate on our [portfolio management](/direction/#portfolio-management-and-issue-management) feature of Epics.
        Just like with issues, you can now comment on epics, and even start standalone, threaded discussions
        in an epic, just like in issues and merge requests. This allows you to have a conversation
        with your teammates, in an epic directly, at a higher abstraction level, before necessarily
        drilling down in an issue, or even creating one.

        This new feature is also supported in [the API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/discussions.html).

        Email notifications and todos are not yet supported in epics, and
        [we are working on them right now](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/148).

    - name: Custom additional text for all emails
      available_in: [premium, ultimate]
      documentation_link: 'https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/settings/email.html'
      documentation_text: "Read through the documentation on custom text for emails"
      image_url: '/images/10_7/custom-text-emails.png'
      reporter: victorwu
      issue_url: 'https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/4474'
      description: |
        Often, organizations need to add a disclaimer or other related text to all email communications,
        for various operational or compliance requirements.

        With this release, we've added this exact feature. GitLab admins can now go into email settings
        and paste in any custom text. That text will then appear at the bottom of all emails sent by GitLab.

    - name: Subgroup issues in Group Issue Board
      available_in: [core, starter, premium, ultimate]
      documentation_link: 'https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issue_board.html'
      documentation_text: "Read through the documentation on Issue Boards"
      image_url: '/images/10_7/board-subgroup-issues.png'
      reporter: victorwu
      issue_url: 'https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/44270'
      description: | # supports markdown
        Group issue boards are a powerful feature to help you manage issues across multiple projects
        across a single group, all in one interface. This is helpful for teams where their work
        might come from multiple different code repositories (and thus GitLab projects).

        Prior to this release, the issues in a group issue board only came from immediate child projects
        of that one group. With this release, all issues in projects in all subgroups of the current group also appear
        in that one group board. So if your work is structured in a group and project hierarchy with multiple
        levels reflecting your organization or software product, then this update will extend that
        hierarchy to the group issue board now, giving you more fine-grained control.

    - name: Assigning and filtering by subgroup labels
      available_in: [core, starter, premium, ultimate]
      documentation_link: 'https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/labels.html'
      documentation_text: "Read through the documentation on Labels"
      image_url: '/images/10_7/ancestor-descendent-group-labels.png'
      image_noshadow: true
      reporter: victorwu
      issue_url: 'https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/40915'
      description: |
        Subgrouping is a powerful feature in GitLab, and we want to extend that functionality to how
        labels are applied in GitLab. With this release, we've made it extremely flexible to apply
        group labels to issues and merge requests at various subgroup levels.

        In particular, for a given issue or merge request, you can now apply any group label from that object's
        ancestor groups. This flexibility means that you can create a label at a given group level, and all
        objects in its subgroups will be able to use it.

        Since in group issue lists and group merge request lists, you can already see objects belonging to subgroups,
        we've now also made it possible to filter on those lists by group labels that belong to both ancestor
        and descendant groups of the given group, since all those objects can have those labels now. In other words,
        GitLab gives you the power and flexibility to filter by any possible label assignable to those objects.

        This filtering capability is also possible in group issue boards for both the filter bar and the board config.

    - name: Project Badges
      available_in: [core, starter, premium, ultimate]
      documentation_link: 'https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/badges.html'
      documentation_text: "Read through the documentation on Project Badges"
      image_url: '/images/10_7/project_badges.png'
      reporter: jramsay
      issue_url: 'https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/41174'
      description: |
        Many projects use badges, such as the
        [GitLab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/settings.html#pipeline-badges)
        and [shields.io](https://shields.io) to reflect status of build and
        code quality. Typically these are added to the project README.

        Now badges are a first-class citizen and can be displayed prominently
        below the project description, and can be templated at the group level too.

    - name: Protected branch unprotect permissions
      available_in: [premium, ultimate]
      documentation_link: 'https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/protected_branches.html#protect-repository-branches'
      documentation_text: "Read through the documentation on Branch Protection"
      reporter: jramsay
      issue_url: 'https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/4800'
      description: |
        Protected branches allow push and merge permissions to be restricted by
        branch, like preventing pushes directly to `master`, but any Master
        can bypass these rules by unprotecting the branch. The new unprotect
        restriction can be used to limit which users, groups and roles are
        allowed to unprotect a branch.

        Unprotect restrictions can only be set using the API in 10.7, but will
        be [available in the interface](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/5496)
        in an upcoming release. The admin access level (`60`) may be removed in
        a future release, as we are currently evaluating restrictions to the
        Owner role as an alternative.

    - name: Issue weight in Issue Board card
      available_in: [starter, premium, ultimate]
      documentation_link: 'https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issue_board.html'
      documentation_text: "Read through the documentation on Issue Boards"
      image_url: '/images/10_7/board-card-issue-weight.png'
      reporter: victorwu
      issue_url: 'https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/4006'
      description: |
        You can now view the weight in an issue board card. Previously, when using an issue
        board, to see the weight of an issue, you'd have to click on the issue, and see the
        weight in the sidebar that slides in. With this change, you can now see it in the board
        card itself. This makes it much more easy to quickly scan a board and see the weights
        of issues, giving you a rough sense of the work required in a given list of issues, which
        is helpful in methodologies such as [Agile](/blog/2018/03/05/gitlab-for-agile-software-development/).

    - name: GitLab Plugins
      available_in: [core, starter, premium, ultimate]
      gitlab_com: false
      documentation_link: 'https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/file_hooks.html'
      documentation_text: "Read through the documentation on Plugins"
      reporter: jramsay
      issue_url: 'https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/40812'
      description: |
        Being open source means GitLab can always be improved by anyone, but
        not all customers want to upstream their changes, or they may want to
        iterate on them privately first. Up to now, this was only possible by
        running a fork of GitLab, which is hard to keep up to date.

        Plugins allow you to respond to
        [GitLab system hooks](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/system_hooks/system_hooks.html)
        with a script stored on the GitLab server, so you can more easily
        extend GitLab to meet your needs, like automatically configuring custom
        protected branch rules whenever a new project is created.

    - name: 'HTTP(s) Git protocol always available for CI/CD jobs'
      available_in: [core, starter, premium, ultimate]
      documentation_link: 'https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/settings/visibility_and_access_controls.html'
      documentation_text: 'Read through the documentation on visibility and access controls'
      issue_url: 'https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/44389'
      reporter: bikebilly
      description: |
        With GitLab you can use either SSH or HTTP(s) to access your repositories.
        Sometimes GitLab administrators prefer to block HTTP(s) access for security reasons. For example,
        blocking HTTP(s) prevents users from disclosing their credentials due to an insecure client setup.
        However, blocking HTTP(S) also stopped GitLab Runner from cloning the repository, making CI/CD not work as expected.

        Starting with GitLab 10.7, the HTTP(s) protocol will be allowed for clone/fetch requests coming
        from GitLab Runner, even if the same access is explicitly forbidden for users.
        This is not susceptible to the same type of inseucre client vulnerability because
        GitLab Runner always uses OTP tokens that cannot be leveraged to perform attacks.

    - name: Support for JSON Web Token OmniAuth
      available_in: [core, starter, premium, ultimate]
      gitlab_com: false

      issue_url: 'https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/43512'
      description: |
        GitLab uses OmniAuth to allow users to sign into GitLab using popular
        services like Twitter and Google, as well as standard authentication
        solutions like OAuth2. In Gitlab 10.7, support for JSON Web Token (JWT)
        OmniAuth has been added.

        JSON Web Token is a compact and self-contained way to securely transmit
        information, and is commonly used for authentication between services.

    - name: Automatic background verification of Geo replicas
      available_in: [premium, ultimate]
      gitlab_com: false
      documentation_link: 'https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/geo/disaster_recovery/background_verification.html'

      issue_url: 'https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/5064'
      description: |
        Automatic background verification of Geo replicas will now occur when
        Geo is enabled, to make sure that replicas remain consistent with the
        primary. This is important when using Geo for Disaster Recovery so that
        you can confidently fail over to a secondary, knowing that it is a
        a complete replica of your primary GitLab instance.

        GitLab calculates a checksum for each Git repository using `heads` and
        `tags` and verifies that the checksum from the primary matches the
        checksum on each secondary. Verification will be expanded in upcoming
        releases to also include
        [uploads](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/5591) and
        [`keep-around` refs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/5196).

        As part of providing additional flexibility around our permission
        model, this will allow group or server admins to set an option that

        Project exports allow you to move projects between GitLab instances
        conveniently, including issues, merge requests, labels, wikis and
        uploads. Project exports now include LFS objects so that repositories
        with LFS objects can also be transferred using project exports.

    - name: Dependency Scanning is now an independent feature
      available_in: [ultimate]
      documentation_link: 'https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/#dependency-scanning'

      description: |
        Before this release, security checks on external dependencies and libraries
        used by your application were done along with SAST. Even if they are
        related, we think that they should be clearly identified as two separate
        features.

        GitLab 10.7 introduces Dependency Scanning as a first-class citizen in
        the Security reports, giving you information about vulnerable libraries
        that should be updated. Results will be available both in the merge request
        and in the pipeline view.

    - name: Runner-specific job timeout

      description: |
        GitLab currently defines at the project level how long a CI/CD job can run.
        If a job execution exceeds this duration, it is automatically stopped and
        reported as failed.

        GitLab 10.7 adds a new timeout setting on the runner itself, which applies
        to all jobs it runs. If this value is less than the project-level setting,
        it will override it. This is particularly helpful for shared runners, in
        order to prevent potential abuse with a project that has set long timeouts.

        When a CI/CD job fails, users normally want to check what happened
        and commit a fix to make it succeed as expected. Before this release,

        To make the debugging easier and faster, GitLab 10.7 introduces the failure
        reason as part of the status badges, make it accessible on mouseover.

        For example if your registry was located at `/var/mypath/gitlab/registry`,
        the restore will now succeed. Previously the task would try to rename the
        existing directory to `<name>.<timestamp>`, but it would not have permission.
        Now it will create a `tmp` folder in the backup directory, and move any
        existing files there prior to restoring the backup.

      description: |
        GitLab Pages can provide static websites via HTTP or HTTPS protocols.
        HTTPS is normally preferred since it encrypts all the traffic, protecting
        the content while it is transferred over the net.

        In the case that both are available, in GitLab 10.7 users can force their projects
        to redirect HTTP requests on the related HTTPS url to improve security and
        guarantee no data is transferred in clear text.

        With GitLab 10.7, we are making it _even easier_ by no longer requiring
        it to be explicitly enabled as well as automating the renewal process.

        With the introduction of [Object Storage support to Core](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/40781),
        the alpha [cloud native GitLab chart](https://gitlab.com/charts/gitlab)
        can now be used without a license. This chart features a more cloud native
        architecture, with a container for each component of GitLab and no requirement
        for shared storage. These changes will result in increased resilience,
        scalability, and performance of GitLab on Kubernetes.

        Summary statistics are now available on the environment metrics
        dashboard, displaying the average and maximum values of each series
        within the timespan. For example it is now possible to quickly see
        the average response time for the past eight hours, to understand
        the experience most users are seeing.

        Total Pod CPU and Memory consumption are now also displayed,
        providing insight into the resource usage of a particular environment
        in the cluster.

# UPGRADE BAROMETER
barometer:
  reporter: jameslopez
  description: |
    To upgrade to GitLab 10.7 from the latest 10.6 version, no downtime is
    required. To upgrade without downtime, please consult the
    [documentation on downtimeless upgrades](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/update/#upgrading-without-downtime).

    Note: There is an issue in 10.7.0 which causes Omnibus GitLab restores to fail if the backup includes container registry images. It will fixed in 10.7.1, and there is an [interim workaround](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/merge_requests/2463#note_69552850) available.

    For this release we have migrations and post-deploy migrations.

    GitLab.com migrations took approximately 3 minutes and post-deploy migrations
    amounted for a total of around 18 minutes. Background migrations on the
    other hand are sidekiq jobs that will run synchronously, for this release
    these migrations took around 4 days to complete, no side effects were
    expected nor present. One of the migrations targets older pipeline builds and
    newer executed pipelines are not affected.

    GitLab Geo users, please consult the documentation on
    [upgrading Geo](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/geo/replication/updating_the_geo_nodes.html).

# DEPRECATIONS
deprecations:
  - feature_name: Mattermost configuration changes
    due: GitLab 11.0.
    reporter: joshlambert
    description: |
      With the release of GitLab 11.0, the number of Mattermost configuration
      options supported within `gitlab.rb` will be reduced. We will continue to
      support the
      [core configuration settings](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/gitlab-mattermost/#upgrading-gitlab-mattermost-from-versions-prior-to-11-0)
      necessary to run Mattermost, and set up the integration with GitLab.
      Going forward, other configuration settings should be set directly within
      the Mattermost console, or
      [passed as environment variables](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/gitlab-mattermost/#upgrading-gitlab-mattermost-from-versions-prior-to-11-0).

      Presently with two applications attempting to write to the same config
      file, changes can be lost.
  - feature_name: Debian 7 Wheezy Support
    due: GitLab 11.0.
    reporter: joshlambert
    description: |
      GitLab 11.0 will be the last release with support for Debian 7 Wheezy.

      Debian Wheezy will be end of lifed by the Debian project
      [at the end of May](https://www.debian.org/releases/wheezy/).
