        By proxying and caching container images from Docker Hub, the Dependency Proxy helps you to improve the performance of your pipelines. Even though the proxy is intended to be heavily used with CI/CD, to use the feature, you had to add your credentials to the `DOCKER_AUTH_CONFIG` CI/CD variable or manually run `docker login` in your pipeline. These solutions worked fine, but when you consider how many `.gitlab-ci.yml` files that you need to update, it would be better if the GitLab Runner could automatically authenticate for you.

        Since the Runner is already able to automatically authenticate with the integrated GitLab Container Registry, we were able to leverage that functionality to help you automatically authenticate with the Dependency Proxy.

        Now it's easier to use the Dependency Proxy to proxy and cache your container images from Docker Hub and start having faster, more reliable builds.
