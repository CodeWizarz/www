    description: |
      Merge request diffs have been calculated by `git diff target...source` which compares `HEAD` of the target with the merge base of `target` and `source`. This works well, until changes from the target branch are merged into the source branch, creating a complete mess of the diff.

      Merge requests now compare to `<default branch> (HEAD)` by default when viewing the changes tab of a merge request. This provides a more accurate and up-to-date diff of the changes during your review.
