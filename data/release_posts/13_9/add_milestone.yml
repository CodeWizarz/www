    description: |
      Not all incidents have the same severity. Many incidents must be immediately addressed to restore the services customers depend on. But some incidents are less critical and can be prioritized against other work and scheduled for a specific release or milestone for implementation. You can now assign low-severity incidents to a milestone from the right sidebar to manage them from your issue boards.
