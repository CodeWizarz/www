    description: |
        In the [last release](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2021/01/22/gitlab-13-8-released/#project-configuration-to-control-storage-of-latest-artifacts), 
        we wanted to improve storage consumption management by adding a project setting 
        to disable keeping the latest artifacts. GitLab recognizes that as a self-managed 
        user, you may want to opt-out for your entire instance, so we have added a 
        one-click option for you to disable keeping the latest artifacts for all your projects.
