    description: |
      This milestone introduces a keyboard shortcut that toggles between [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) and [GitLab Next](https://next.gitlab.com/). By using the `g` and `x` keys, which work from any area of GitLab, you can easily switch between GitLab and GitLab Next. A huge thanks to [Yogi](https://gitlab.com/yo) for a great community contribution!
