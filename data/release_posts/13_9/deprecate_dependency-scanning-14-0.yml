      Previously to exclude a DS analyzer, you needed to remove it from the default list of analyzers and use that to set the `DS_DEFAULT_ANALYZERS` variable in your project's CI template. We determined it should be easier to avoid running a particular analyzer without losing the benefit of newly added analyzers. As a result we ask you to migrate from `DS_DEFAULT_ANALYZERS` to `DS_EXCLUDED_ANALYZERS` when it is available. Read about it in [issue #287691](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/287691) or [this blog post](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/02/08/composition-analysis-14-deprecations-and-removals/).

      Previously to prevent the Gemnasium analyzers to fetch the advisory database at runtime, you needed to set the `GEMNASIUM_DB_UPDATE` env variable. Though, this is not documented properly and its naming is inconsistent with the equivalent `BUNDLER_AUDIT_UPDATE_DISABLED` variable. As a result we ask you to migrate from `GEMNASIUM_DB_UPDATE` to `GEMNASIUM_UPDATE_DISABLED` when it is available. Read about it in [issue #215483](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/215483) or [this blog post](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/02/08/composition-analysis-14-deprecations-and-removals/).
