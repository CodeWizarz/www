    description: |
      When viewing a roadmap, there used to be no way to hide confidential epics from the main view. This could be frustrating if you wanted to share your roadmap with a public audience.

      In this release we've updated the search bar filter to include confidentiality. You now have another layer in which you can refine your roadmap.
