    description: |
      To simplify integrations with HashiCorp Vault, we've shipped
      Vault JWT token support. From the launch, you could restrict access based on
      data in the JWT. This release gives you a new dimension for restricting
      access to credentials: the environment a job targets.

      This release extends the existing Vault JWT token to support environment-based
      restrictions too. As the `environment` name could be supplied by the user running
      the pipeline, we recommend you use the new environment-based restrictions with the
      already-existing `ref_type` values for maximum security.
