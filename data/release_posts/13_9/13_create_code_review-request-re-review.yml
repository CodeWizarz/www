    description: |
      Merge request authors receive [feedback from reviewers](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/reviews/). Often, this feedback needs to be re-reviewed to make sure all issues have been appropriately addressed. As the author of the contribution, you need to communicate the need for a follow-up to your reviewer.

      For reviewers who have already [reviewed a merge request](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/discussions/#merge-request-reviews), you can now request a re-review. This request triggers a To-Do item and email notification to alert the user that you need a follow-up review of your contribution.
