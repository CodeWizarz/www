    description: |
      GitLab [security scans](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/#security-scanning-tools) automatically detect code language and run appropriate analyzers. With monorepos, microservices, and multi-project repositories, more than one project can exist within a single GitLab repository. Previously our .NET SAST tool could only detect single projects in repositories. With this release, our .NET SAST analyzer can [now intelligently detect multiple solution files (.sln) in .NET projects](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#supported-languages-and-frameworks) and report vulnerabilities across them. This will make it easier and more streamlined for users with multi-project .NET repos to leverage our SAST scanning.
