    description: |
      GitLab users can now follow other users' activity in GitLab! Following users helps you to stay updated on activity by team mates and key project contributors. You can follow or unfollow other users from their user profiles. To see their activity go to the top-level Activity view, and select the Followed Users tab.

      Thanks to the amazing work from GitLab contributor [Roger Meier](https://gitlab.com/bufferoverflow) from [Siemens](https://gitlab.com/siemens) over the past 3 months, this feature is now available in 13.9.
