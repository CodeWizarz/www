    description: |
      Previously released, [group code coverage data](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2020/11/22/gitlab-13-6-released/#display-code-coverage-data-for-selected-projects) is an easy way to see current test coverage of the projects in a group and to get raw data for visualization outside of GitLab. Group code coverage data now includes a graph of the average coverage for all of a group's projects so you can see how test coverage for the group is trending over time at a glance.
