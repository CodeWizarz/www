      Many customers use Jira as their single source of truth for tracking issues and engineering work. When using GitLab for SCM and CI/CD, they can take advantage of our existing integration to pass information from MRs and commits into existing Jira issues. However, until now there has been no way to automatically pass information about vulnerabilities detected by security scanners into Jira. This leaves users who rely on Jira to track work no choice but to manually copy vulnerability information into new Jira issues.

      To address this, we're introducing a new ability to create Jira issues directly from a vulnerability's details. You will see this as a new option in your existing Jira integration settings. Simply enable the new option and select the desired Jira issue type. Available issue types are pulled automatically based on the currently configured Jira target project. Once enabled, all places in your project where you can create GitLab issues from a vulnerability will instead directly create a Jira issue of the configured type.
