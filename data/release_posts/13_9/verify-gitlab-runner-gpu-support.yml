    description: |
      Specialized compute workloads like those used in machine learning can significantly benefit from access to GPUs. Developers can configure GitLab Runner to leverage GPUs in the Docker executor by forwarding the `--gpu` flag. You can also use this with recent support in [GitLab's fork of Docker Machine](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/executors/docker_machine.html#using-the-forked-version-of-docker-machine), which allows you to [accelerate workloads with attached GPUs](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gpus/create-vm-with-gpus). Doing so can help control costs associated with potentially expensive machine configurations.
