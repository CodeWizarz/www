      description: |
        You can use the GitLab Package Registry to publish your Java dependencies with Maven or Gradle. By default, you can publish the same package name and version multiple times. This default was chosen based on the behavior of the most common public registries.

        However, many of you have expressed that you'd like to prevent duplicate uploads, especially when it comes to releases. We've added a new group setting for the Package Registry, and you can now choose whether you'd like to allow or prevent duplicate Maven or Gradle uploads. As mentioned, to match the behavior of the public registries, duplicates will be allowed by default.

        You can adjust this setting by using the [GitLab API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/graphql/reference/index.html#packagesettings) or from the application by navigating to **Settings > Packages & Registries**. In the coming milestones, we plan to expand this setting for each package manager format and add it to the user interface. Please follow along in the [epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5070) or consider contributing a change!
