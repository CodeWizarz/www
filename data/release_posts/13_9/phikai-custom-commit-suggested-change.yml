        [Suggesting changes](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/discussions/#suggest-changes) to a merge request makes code review faster and easier by quickly proposing changes and applying the given feedback at a click of a button. However, we had a default commit message for applied suggestions that couldn't be customized, preventing users from describing the change and eventually violating the project's commit messages guidelines.

        As a result, merge request authors were often forced to squash commits for the whole merge request, or having to manually apply suggestions locally, or going back and rewording the commits after applying the suggestions.

        When applying a suggestion you're now able to write a custom commit message. This allows authors and contributors to accept suggestions and follow commit message best practices for their projects. If no custom commit message is specified the suggestion is committed with a default commit message.
