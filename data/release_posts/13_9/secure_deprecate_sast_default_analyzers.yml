  description: |
    Until 13.9, if you wanted to avoid running one particular GitLab SAST analyzer, you needed to remove it from the [long string of analyzers in the `SAST.gitlab-ci.yml` file](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/390afc431e7ce1ac253b35beb39f19e49c746bff/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml#L12) and use that to set the [`SAST_DEFAULT_ANALYZERS`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#docker-images) in your project's CI file. If you did this, it would exclude you from future new analyzers because this string hard codes the list of analyzers to execute. We avoid this problem by inverting this variable's logic to exclude, rather than choose default analyzers. 
    Beginning with 13.9, [we are migrating](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/14fed7a33bfdbd4663d8928e46002a5ef3e3282c/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml#L13) to `SAST_EXCLUDED_ANALYZERS` in our `SAST.gitlab-ci.yml` file. We encourage anyone who uses a [customized SAST configuration](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#customizing-the-sast-settings) in their project CI file to migrate to this new variable. If you have not overridden `SAST_DEFAULT_ANALYZERS`, no action is needed. `SAST_DEFAULT_ANALYZERS` will be removed in GitLab 14.0, which will release on June 22, 2021.
