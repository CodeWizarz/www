    description: |
      Microsoft's [release of .NET 5.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/dotnet-five) is the next major release of .NET Core which supports more types of apps and more platforms than .NET Core or .NET Framework. We have updated our .NET SAST analyzer, [Security Code Scan](https://security-code-scan.github.io/) to support this new version which is also now supported with [our SAST language detection](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#supported-languages-and-frameworks) allowing GitLab SAST to automatically detect .NET 5 projects. This change was part of a community contribution by [@shaun.burns](https://gitlab.com/shaun.burns).
