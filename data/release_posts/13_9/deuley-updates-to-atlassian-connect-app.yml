      You can now sync your Jira Cloud project data with GitLab by using the [GitLab.com for Jira Cloud](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1221011/gitlab-com-for-jira-cloud?tab=overview&hosting=cloud) application, available on the Atlassian Marketplace. This plugin displays information about your branches, commits, merge requests, deployments, and feature flags in the Jira Development Panel. Use it to see the current status of work in progress, then quickly navigate back to those pages inside of GitLab.

      To make these features easier to use, we've made significant improvements to the initial setup process over the last few milestones, and now getting your GitLab namespaces connected is easier than ever. To get started, check it out on [the Atlassian Marketplace](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1221011/gitlab-com-for-jira-cloud?tab=overview&hosting=cloud).
