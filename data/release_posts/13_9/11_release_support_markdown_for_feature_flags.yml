    description: |
      This release adds Markdown linking for Feature Flags. Users can mention `[feature_flag:<IID>]` in discussions or comments to refer a specific Feature Flag. Click on the generated link to go to that Feature Flag's edit page. This makes collaboration on Feature Flags much easier and more convenient.
