    description: |
      GitLab has made it easier for you to build subgroup management automation with a subgroup webhook. This webhook is triggered when a subgroup is created or deleted.  Automation can now be built without relying on continuous API calls, which is cumbersome and puts an unnecessary performance load on your GitLab instance.
