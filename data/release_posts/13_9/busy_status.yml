      description: |
        In 13.8 we [added a User Busy indicator](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2021/01/22/gitlab-13-8-released/#busy-status-indicator) to indicate whether coworkers are available for code reviews and other tasks. In this release, we've now included the User Busy indicator in the Assignee section of issue and merge request sidebars.
