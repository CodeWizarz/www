    description: |
      Vulnerability Reports are often the primary way security teams triage and manage vulnerabilities. The current filtering and sorting options provide quick ways to focus the list view on a subset of vulnerabilities for more efficient workflows. You can also see any vulnerabilities that have associated issues or which subsequent scans indicate are resolved. This Activity column indicates at a glance which vulnerabilities might be ready to close out, which are in progress, and which ones might need some attention. However, this column was not one you could filter or sort on!

      Now have even more control of your Vulnerability Report experience with the introduction of an Activity filter. Available in the Project, Group, and Security Center Vulnerability Reports, this new filter allows you to view vulnerabilities with issues that are not yet resolved, that are resolved but have no associated issues, that have issues and are resolved, or that have no activity. The available filter options are mutually exclusive sets, allowing you to drill into precisely the vulnerability list view you need for any task.
