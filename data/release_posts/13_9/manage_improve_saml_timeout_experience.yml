    description: |
      When a user's SAML session for a GitLab.com group reaches the 7 day timeout limit, the user will no longer need to click a confirmation page to renew their session. GitLab will automatically reach out to the Group's Identity Provider to check for a valid session and extend it as needed. This change improves the group member's experience and opens the door for decreasing the SAML session timeout in the future.
