      description: |
        When you are reviewing failed tests in a pipeline, it's difficult to tell if a failing test is a legitimate failure that needs investigation or a flaky test that will pass on the next execution.

        The next iteration of the [repeat failed test counter](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2021/01/22/gitlab-13-8-released/#repeat-failed-test-counter) adds the repeat failed test counter to the unit test report. Now you can see how often a test has failed on the default branch without needing a merge request associated with the test execution.
