    description: |
      You can now run coverage-guided fuzz tests against your Python and
      JavaScript apps! These are two of the most popular languages and we're
      excited to support them for use in coverage-guided fuzz testing.

      To run fuzz tests against apps written in these languages, use the
      [same workflow](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/coverage_fuzzing/#configuration)
      you would for any other supported language. Create a fuzz testing
      job to run in your pipeline. When GitLab runs it, any fuzzing results
      automatically appear in the the Security Dashboard, and in the Security
      tab of the pipeline.
