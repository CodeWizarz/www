      description: |
        Communicating your strategic plans or reporting on current work in flight requires being able to focus and filter the view of your roadmap. Further refine your roadmap view by filtering the visible epics by milestone.

        This feature was behind a feature flag since GitLab 13.7, and now it's available for everyone.
