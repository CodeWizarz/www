      Helm v2 was [officially deprecated](https://helm.sh/blog/helm-v2-deprecation-timeline/) in November of 2020, with the `stable` repository being [de-listed from the Helm Hub](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2020/11/09/ensure-auto-devops-work-after-helm-stable-repo/) shortly thereafter. With the release of GitLab 14.0, which will include the 5.0 release of the [GitLab Helm chart](https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/), Helm v2 will no longer be  supported.

      The Cloud Native GitLab Helm chart will not immediately be altered to Helm v3's new schema, but moving forward there are opportunities for improved maintainability we would like to be able to leverage. Deprecating the constraint that functionality be limited to that within Helm v2 allows us to better the experience for our users.
