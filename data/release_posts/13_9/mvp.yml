    In 13.9, Andreas [added Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) support](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/merge_requests/1955) in GitLab Runner. This change enables you to train machine learning models, render animations, or offload other calculations. For more details, see the [item below](#gpu-and-smart-scheduling-support-for-gitlab-runner). This merge request finally landed for 13.9 thanks to Andreas' persistence and responsiveness to many rounds of reviews spanning over 10 months. Thank you Andreas! ðŸ™Œ
