    description: |
      In this milestone, we added the ability to use the release-cli with a `PRIVATE-TOKEN` as defined in the [Create a release](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/releases/#create-a-release) API documentation. This enables overriding the user that creates a release, and supports automation by allowing connection of a project-level `PRIVATE-TOKEN` or by using a bot user account's `PRIVATE-TOKEN`.
