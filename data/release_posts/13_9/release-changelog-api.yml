      Previously, generating a changelog using GitLab was a manual process. Release Managers had to collect all the changes for a given release and then manually add them to a changelog file, which was time-consuming and prone to error. To make this process easier, we have now added an API that will automatically generate a changelog for a given release based on commit history. This enables development teams to better communicate changes to end users by delivering a consistent and comprehensive set of changelogs for every release.
