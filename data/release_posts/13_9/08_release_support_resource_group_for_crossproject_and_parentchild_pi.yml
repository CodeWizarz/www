    description: |
      You can now benefit from using [resource groups](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/resource_groups/index.html#pipeline-level-concurrency-control-with-cross-projectparent-child-pipelines) if your deployment process uses [child pipelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/parent_child_pipelines.html) or [multi-project pipelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/multi_project_pipelines.html). Such pipelines may contain multiple stages, multiple jobs, and even span across multiple projects. Resource groups ensure only one downstream deployment pipeline runs at a time so you can deploy safely. Previously, `resource_group` only supported deployment jobs in the same project.
