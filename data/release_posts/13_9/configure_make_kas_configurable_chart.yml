    description: |
      Users of Kubernetes Agent Server (kas) until now had to use command line arguments to customize their Agent Server installations. This setup proves inadequate for large-scale installations where declarative, repeatable setups are a core part of the workflow, and many arguments need custom settings. With the current GitLab release, the [Kubernetes Agent Server helm charts](https://docs.gitlab.com/charts/charts/gitlab/kas/) can be installed by custom configs that get merged with the default configurations to make it simple to integrate an Agent Server installation with existing observability and monitoring tools.
