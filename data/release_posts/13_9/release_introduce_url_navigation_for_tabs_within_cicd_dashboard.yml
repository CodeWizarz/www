    description: |
      In 13.8, we added support for [deployment frequency charts](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/analytics/ci_cd_analytics.html#deployment-frequency-charts) under CI/CD Analytics. In this milestone, we added the ability to navigate directly to each of the CI/CD analytics charts by introducing a URL for each tab, making it easy to bookmark this page or send it to additional colleagues to view.
