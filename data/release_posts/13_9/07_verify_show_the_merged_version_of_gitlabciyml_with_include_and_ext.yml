    description: |
        When configuring pipelines, you use keywords like [`include`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#include) and [`extends`](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#extends) often. These keywords help break down one long pipeline configuration file into multiple files, which increases readability and reduces duplication. Unfortunately, those keywords can make a pipeline configuration hard to follow. In some configurations, a [pipeline configuration file](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml#L91) can be mostly composed of a list of other included configuration files.

        In this release, you can view a version of your pipeline configuration with all of the `include` and `extends` configurations merged together. It's now much easier to understand more complex pipeline flows and simplifies the debugging process.
