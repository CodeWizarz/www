    description: |
      In GitLab 13.9, we introduced an API to manage [project access tokens](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/settings/project_access_tokens.html#project-access-tokens). API Access for project access tokens enable integration for users that want to control project access tokens provisioning in external systems or through custom automation.
