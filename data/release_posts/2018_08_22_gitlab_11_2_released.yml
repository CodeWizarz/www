        Working on web applications is faster and easier when it is possible to
        see your changes. Modern JavaScript frameworks now support live preview,
        eliminating the need to restart development servers and refresh the
        browser, but when editing these web applications using the Web IDE, it
        wasn't possible to see your changes before commiting them.

        In GitLab 11.2 you can preview your JavaScript web application in the
        Web IDE and see your changes in real time. This makes it possible to
        test a fix before you commit, quickly experiment with a change, or
        even contribute to an open source project without ever cloning it
        locally.

        Client-side evaluation is powered by
        [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io). It can be enabled by an admin for
        self-managed GitLab instances and is already enabled for all projects on
        GitLab.com. Later this year we will add
        [server-side evaluation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/4013)
        powered by GitLab CI, allowing you to test and preview Ruby applications and more!

        In today's fast-growing development environment, moving from an idea to
        setting up a new project from scratch is still a tedious task. There's not
        only a lot of boilerplate code involved, but also additional administrative
        overhead preventing your users from getting started right away.

        Starting with this release, we enable organizations to manage their own
        project templates. As a GitLab admin, you can now define a group within
        your installation that serves as source for custom templates. All direct
        child projects of this group are available as templates when creating a
        new project.

        All relevant repository and database information of a template are copied
        over to your new project, including the project and wiki repository, issues,
        project configuration, and more.

        together with your colleagues and community, it can be helpful to communicate what you are up
        to, including your availability or current workload.

        With GitLab 11.2, we are bringing status messages right to your personal profile!
        Within your profile settings, you can now add a status including an emoji and custom message.
        This status will show up on your profile page, as well as in comments and author titlebars, exposing your
        current status to everyone who is working with you.

      description: |
        As instances grow, projects and groups can multiply and become
        increasingly hard to find, so GitLab requires a powerful search experience.
        In this release, we're taking a step forward to make search clearer,
        more consistent, and easier than ever to use.

        In 11.2, we're improving search by removing project and group scoping from
        the search bar. Instead of restricting search to the project/group you're in,
        GitLab now gives you a consistent experience with the ability to search
        instance-wide from the top of every page.

        We've also made search easier to use by showing group and project icons
        in the results, plus expanding the width of the search bar accordingly.

    - name: "Support for Android project import"
      available_in: [core, starter, premium, ultimate]

      description: |
        Until now, importing complex project structures with multiple sub-structures was a tedious,
        time-consuming task.

        With this release, we introduce support for manifest files for project imports. A manifest
        XML file contains metadata for groups of repositories, allowing you to import larger project
        structures with multiple repositories in one go.

        When creating a new project, there is a new option to choose a "Manifest file" as source of
        your project import on the "Import project" tab. In addition, you can select from the list of
        individual projects in a subsequent step if you don't want to import the complete project
        structure.

        This improvement allows you to import the Android OS code from the
        [Android Open Source Project (AOSP)](https://source.android.com),
        as one exciting use case. You can also import other projects that use manifest files which meet our
        [format requirements](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/import/manifest.html#manifest-format).

    - name: "Issue board milestone lists"

      description: |
        Issue boards were originally designed to support workflow tracking with label-based lists.
        In GitLab 11.0, we introduced [assignee lists](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issue_board.html#assignee-lists)
        to help teams see issues assigned to different team members and allow quick reassignments.

        With this release, we are introducing a third type of list, the milestone list. All issues
        assigned to the given milestone will appear in a milestone list. This allows teams to see
        issues in different milestones all at once in a single board with multiple milestone lists.
        This also means you can quickly move issues across different milestones.
        With the [summed weights](#summed-weights-in-issue-board-list) feature also in this release,
        this is especially useful for teams who want to balance total issue weight across milestones,
        not over-scoping or under-scoping in a given milestone.

        We've also updated the API so that you can now add and remove all three types of lists on
        a given board.

# SECONDARY FEATURES

      issue_url: 'https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/5481'
      description: |
        Todos are a helpful personal productivity tool integrated directly into GitLab. When you
        are @-mentioned in an issue or merge request, you get a dismissible todo object in GitLab
        along with an email alert. And there are lots of other todo trigger events as well.

        With this release, we are bringing todos to epics, similar to their availability in issues and merge requests.
        When you are @-mentioned in an epic, you will get a todo for it, streamlining your personal workflows.
        You can also create a todo manually from the sidebar when viewing an epic itself, again similar to the capability within issues and merge requests.

        The API has also been updated so that you can access epic-triggered todos and
        create a todo for an epic, all via the API itself.

    - name: "Summed weights in issue board list"

      issue_url: 'https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/3772'
      description: |
        Prior to this release, we already showed the issue counts at the top of each list in issue boards.
        This is helpful if you are doing any type of planning or tracking in an issue board, to see how
        many issues are in a particular workflow stage or assigned to a person in an assignee list.

        With this release, we are extending that concept to show the summed weights of all issues in each list
        alongside the issue count. This gives even more granularity to teams who use weights for effort
        estimation. You can now see at a glance how much weight is in a list, and if you need to move issues
        between lists to compensate for too much or too little weight, you can now do so and the summed
        weights will update immediately. You don't have to refresh the board.

      description: |
        Milestones in GitLab are useful for tracking work within an iteration or a sprint.
        In particular, group-level milestones allow issues across several different projects
        to be tracked together.

        With this release, we are showing group milestones on the dashboard milestones page.
        This means that users will now be able to see all milestones (both project and group
        milestones) that they have access to in the GitLab instance, all in a single location.

    - name: "Search labels in project labels list"
      available_in: [core, starter, premium, ultimate]

      issue_url: 'https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/34837'
      description: |
        Labels in GitLab are a versatile feature, allowing you to categorize issues, merge requests,
        and epics. Teams use them for a variety of use cases, and it's not uncommon for projects
        to have many pages of labels. As a result, it's often cumbersome to change a label name, its
        description, or its color. You have to click through many pages to get to the label you care about
        on the labels list page.

        In this release, we've made that easier by providing a search feature in the project labels list
        page itself. The search covers both the label title and description. So if you know the label title
        or even know just what the label is about, you can quickly find it by typing a search term in the text box.

    - name: "All burndown charts available in GitLab Starter and GitLab.com Bronze"

      issue_url: 'https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/6251'
      description: |
        The burndown chart is a useful visualization for teams to track work as it is being completed
        during a milestone. It allows teams to anticipate risks early on, and make adjustments to mitigate them
        early in the cycle, rather than wait until the milestone is done.

        Previously, for the group milestone page, the burndown chart was only available in GitLab Premium and
        GitLab.com Silver. In this release, we've brought that feature to GitLab Starter and GitLab.com Bronze,
        allowing more users to enjoy group-based use cases. This also simplifies the feature, since the
        burndown chart on the project milestone page was already available with the Starter/Bronze tier.

        GitLab includes a fully integrated performance monitoring solution, providing an easy and seamless
        way for engineers to view key metrics like throughput, error rate, and resource consumption. While it is
        critical to be able to view these metrics when needed, it is also important to be able to be proactively
        notified in the event of issues, to expedite a response.

        GitLab 11.2 now provides the ability to easily create alerts for custom metrics directly from the dashboard,
        with just a few clicks. Users can set the desired threshold, and when it's exceeded for five minutes, email notifications
        will be sent to maintainers and owners of the project. GitLab-provided metrics will be supported in a
        [future release](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/6948).

      description: |
        Many teams using GitLab also use Jira as an issue tracker. GitLab has a Jira
        integration that allows GitLab merge requests to automatically close a Jira
        issue when the merge request is merged. This requires you to configure a
        Jira transition ID in the GitLab settings, indicating how you want to transition
        Jira issues into the closed state. But this also means you are limited to
        only a single transition type on the Jira side.

        With this release, we now support multiple Jira transition IDs. That means if
        your Jira project is set up such that there are multiple ways to close a Jira issue,
        you can have GitLab recognize all those ways, so that merging a GitLab merge request
        will close the Jira issue, regardless of which state the Jira issue starts in.

        [Helm](https://helm.sh) chart is now generally available (GA). This chart features a more cloud native architecture,
        with a container for each component of GitLab and no requirement
        for shared storage. These changes result in increased resilience,
        scalability, and performance of GitLab on Kubernetes. A [GitLab Runner](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/) is also deployed,
        making it easy to get started with [GitLab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/).

        The `gitlab` chart is the best way to deploy GitLab on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). Give it

        With GitLab 11.2, it is now possible to import your projects from Bitbucket Server to GitLab
        with minimal effort. All that is required is to provide the server URL and your credentials.
        GitLab then lists all your Bitbucket Server repositories, ready for import.

        License Management automatically detects the software licenses that you

        allow you to define a policy about the licenses that should be allowed
        in your production code.

        With GitLab 11.2, you can now define whether any license should be approved
        or blacklisted for your application as soon as the relevant code is introduced
        in a merge request. The merge request widget displays all new licenses
        that have not yet been introduced into the target branch, and allows you

        In large organizations, SSH keys may only be issued on a temporary basis
        and be set to expire quickly. An alternative approach, available with
        GitLab 11.2, is to use OpenSSH certificates which include all the information
        about the user within the certificate. This removes the need for users
        to generate and upload SSH keys.

        Analytics are an important tool for understanding activity on your GitLab instance.
        Previously, two of these features – ConvDev Index and Cohorts – have
        only been visible to admins.

        Since these features provide useful (and anonymized) information on GitLab
        usage, we are making them visible to all users, by default, behind a new
        "Instance Statistics" section in the top navigation bar.
        Visibility of this section is configurable, and can be set to admin-only.

        Introducing instance-level statistics is our first step to democratize
        analytics in GitLab, and we are excited to introduce more to this section
        in the future.

        When utilizing a Wiki in your GitLab project for extended documentation, the right sidebar shows
        a hierarchical table of contents of your Wiki page structure by default. There are cases, however,
        where you may want to provide additional content, extending this set of automatically listed pages.

        With GitLab 11.2, we introduce an option to override the generated table of contents via your
        own custom sidebar. By adding a `_sidebar` Wiki page, maintainers gain full freedom to define an
        individual Wiki sidebar based on [GitLab Flavored Markdown](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html#gitlab-flavored-markdown-gfm).

        Historically, building Docker images within a containerized environment has required compromises, using techniques
        like [docker-in-docker](https://blog.docker.com/2013/09/docker-can-now-run-within-docker/) on
        [privileged containers](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#runtime-privilege-and-linux-capabilities).
        These solutions are often insecure and slow.

        In order to improve the security of Kubernetes clusters integrated with GitLab,

        Starting in GitLab 11.2, all new Helm Tiller applications that are deployed to
        Kubernetes clusters via GitLab's Kubernetes integration will be locked down using
        mutual SSL authentication. This means no other clients outside of your GitLab instance
        will be able to deploy applications, making your cluster more secure. Additionally, starting
        with this release, we will be using Helm Tiller version 2.7.2.

# UPGRADE BAROMETER
barometer:
  reporter: jivanvl
  description: |
    To upgrade to GitLab 11.2 from the latest 11.1 version, no downtime is required. To upgrade without downtime, please consult the [documentation on downtimeless upgrades](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/update/#upgrading-without-downtime).

    For this release we have migrations, post-deploy migrations, and to help with larger migrations, we have introduced background migrations.

    GitLab.com migrations took approximately 25 minutes and post-deploy migrations amounted to a total of around 1 minute. Background migrations on the other hand are Sidekiq jobs that will run synchronously. For this release, these migrations took less than a day to complete, and no side effects were expected nor present. These target completed pipeline builds. Pipelines executed after upgrading are not affected.

    GitLab Geo users, please consult the documentation on [upgrading Geo](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/geo/replication/updating_the_geo_nodes.html).

    If you are using [Advanced Global Search](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/search/advanced_search.html), please be advised that a re-index is necessary in order to [fix a bug](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/5705) that would cause some Note types to not be indexed.

# DEPRECATIONS
deprecations:
  - feature_name: "Change to existing Projects API `archived` parameter"
    type: breaking change
    due: August 22, 2018
    reporter: rymai
    description: |
      [GitLab 10.0](/releases/2017/09/22/gitlab-10-0-released/#api-v3) introduced a
      change that caused the `archived` parameter for the
      [`GET /projects` endpoint](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/projects.html#list-all-projects)
      to behave in a confusing way:

      - Not supplying the parameter would only return non-archived projects
      - Passing `archived=true` would return all projects,
        including those that were archived
      - Passing `archived=false` would only return non-archived projects

      The 11.2 release [corrects this regression](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/20566):

      - Not supplying the parameter now **returns all projects, including those
        that were archived**
      - Passing `archived=true` now **only returns the archived projects**
      - Passing `archived=false` still only returns non-archived projects (no
        behavior change)

      If you are using this API endpoint, you may want to change your current
      usage as follows:

      | Current usage (from GitLab 10.0 to 11.2) | New usage (starting with GitLab 11.2) |
      | ------------- | --------- |
      | No `archived` parameter | Pass `archived=false` |
      | Using `archived=true` | Don't use the `archived` parameter anyore |
      | Using `archived=false` | No change needed |

    reporter: akaemmerle
    description: |
      In previous versions, it was possible to configure GitLab's SAML and Bitbucket
      integrations even when
      [OmniAuth](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/omniauth.html) – which both
      integrations require – was disabled on the instance. (Note that OmniAuth is
      disabled by default for new installations.) We have now streamlined this behavior
      in that both integrations are unavailable when OmniAuth is disabled.
  - feature_name: "Support for Docker Versions in GitLab Runner"
    due: October 22, 2018
    reporter: jyavorska
    description: |
      With GitLab 11.4 (October 22, 2018), support for Docker versions before 1.12 (API version 1.24) will be deprecated in line with
      Docker's latest [version recommendation guidance](https://docs.docker.com/develop/sdk/#api-version-matrix). Beyond
      the 11.4 release these older versions will no longer be officially supported and could stop working at any time.
  - feature_name: "GitLab Pages IP on GitLab.com - DNS <code>A</code> records must be updated"
    due: October 23, 2018
    reporter: jyavorska
    description: |
      On August 11, [GitLab.com migrated from Azure to Google Cloud Platform](/blog/2018/07/19/gcp-move-update/#gitlab-pages-and-custom-domains)
      and with it, GitLab Pages websites also live in a new place. For this reason,
      GitLab.com users who have configured a custom root domain for their Pages sites
      using a DNS `A` record **must** update their records from `52.167.214.135` to `35.185.44.232`.
      <del>Meanwhile, there is a proxy in place to keep your websites up and running
      using the old IP address through Monday, October 22.</del> **Update:** The temporary proxy was
      inadvertently removed ahead of schedule, so affected users should update their
      Gitlab Pages' DNS `A` record immediately. For more information, see our
      [GitLab Pages Update](/blog/2018/08/28/gitlab-pages-update/) post.

      We had changed the Pages IP on GitLab.com in the past, and the steps you need to follow are
      the same as those detailed in [this earlier blog post](/releases/2017/03/06/we-are-changing-the-ip-of-gitlab-pages-on-gitlab-com/),
      with the exception of the new IP itself. <del>We plan to forward the old IPs for
      the foreseeable future, but strongly advise you to update your DNS `A`
      records immediately, otherwise, from October 23 onward, your websites
      may not be available until you make this change.</del> Note that DNS `CNAME`
      records do not need to be changed. GitLab self-managed instances are not
      affected by this change.

      This section will be updated if any additional information is posted.
