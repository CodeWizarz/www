    description: |
      Dependency Scanning no longer supports Python 2 (set via `DS_PYTHON_VERSION: 2`) which was [sunset Jan 1 2020](https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/). If you need Python 2 you will need to use container version v2.10.0 (e.g. registry.gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/retire.js:2.10.0) or earlier.
