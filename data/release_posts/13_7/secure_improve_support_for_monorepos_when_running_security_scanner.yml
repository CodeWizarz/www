    description: |
      GitLab [security scans](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/#security-scanning-tools) automatically detect code language and run appropriate analyzers. With monorepos, microservices, and multi-project repositories, more than one project can exist in a single GitLab repository. Previously our security tools could only detect single projects in repositories. With this release, our SAST analyzers can [now intelligently detect multi-project repositories and run appropriate scanners](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#supported-languages-and-frameworks) for each project and report vulnerabilities. This will make it easier and more streamlined for users with multi-project repos to leverage our security tools. [Future updates](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/219937) will further improve the dashboard and reporting functionality for these types of projects.
