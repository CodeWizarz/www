      description: |
        The email address for the GitLab Service Desk has been difficult
        to remember, and therefore difficult for your users to use. With the
        introduction of configurable email address, it's now possible to choose an
        address suffix that makes sense for your business identity, and is easier for your
        users to remember. This is one more step GitLab is taking to enable you to
        provide top quality support to your users.
