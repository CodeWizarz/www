    description: |
      In previous GitLab versions, the GitLab Agent for Kubernetes required users to collect all Kubernetes resources into a single manifest file. In this version of GitLab, the Agent can now grab Kubernetes manifests recursively from specified directories in your project. Your platform engineers can use a single repository to manage different clusters from one place, and can describe large deployments with a single Agent.
