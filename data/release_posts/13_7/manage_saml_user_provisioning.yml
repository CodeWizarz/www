    description: |
      Previously, users needed to complete a sign-up form as part of onboarding into a SAML-enabled group. In GitLab 13.7, we have introduced user provisioning for SAML-enabled groups. When a user signs in to a SAML-enabled group for the first time, a user account will be created for them automatically if there isn't an existing user with the same email. SAML provisioning improves the onboarding experience for new users and ensures that newly created accounts contain the right information.
