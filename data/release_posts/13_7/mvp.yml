    Rachel has been actively helping the Technical Writing team enforce consistent writing style to fix [the use of future tense](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/284446) in our docs. In 13.7, Rachel [opened 33 MRs](https://gitlab.com/dashboard/merge_requests?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=all&author_username=gottesman.rachelg&milestone_title=13.7), helping the team chip away at an important and laborious task. Thank you Rachel! ðŸ™Œ
