      Merge request reviews are an essential task to ensure quality code from contributors, as this is where most of the communication between author and reviewer takes place. However, as merge requests become larger and more files are involved, navigation and performance of merge request diffs can become difficult.

      GitLab 13.7 introduces the option to show one file at a time in the merge request view. As you navigate to the **Changes** tab of the merge request, click the gear icon and check the box labeled **Show one file at a time**. This will display a single file at a time and enable the **Prev** and **Next** buttons to navigate among files.

      Single file mode provides a cleaner workspace and enhances the reviewer focus on a single file, while improving the performance and navigation of the merge request diff.
