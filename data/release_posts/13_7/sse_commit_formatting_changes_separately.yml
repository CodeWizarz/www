        The Static Site Editor offers an intuitive and familiar WYSIWYG editing mode for Markdown content. To ensure consistently formatted Markdown output, the WYSIWYG editor automatically reformats the page content to match the styling conventions defined in the Markdown parser. This happens entirely in the background before you even start editing. These formatting changes, however, are committed at the same time as your content edits. If the page you are editing did not follow the same styling conventions, it can be difficult for reviewers of the resulting merge request to differentiate between your intentional changes and the automatic formatting.

        Starting in GitLab 13.7, the Static Site Editor will automatically fix inconsistencies in the Markdown syntax and commit any necessary formatting changes to a new branch. Once you're done editing, the Publish button creates a separate commit that contains only your changes. This can save time for your reviewers, who instead of having to sift through syntax changes, can focus on your content.

        In the future, we plan to make the formatting preferences customizable and you can [follow the related issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/244483) for updates.
