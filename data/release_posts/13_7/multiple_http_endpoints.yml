    description: |
      Alert integrations are a critical part of your Incident management workflows, which is why it is important for you and your team to have granular control over the endpoints and authentication tokens. The last thing you want is to take down all of your alerting by resetting a single authentication token! Setting up a HTTP endpoint for each of your monitoring tools allows your team to separately manage each tool without impacting alerting from other tools.
