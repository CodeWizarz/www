      description: |
        Previously when you wanted to manually run a pipeline, you needed to know the relevant variables and then enter them on the "Run Pipeline" page. This can be tedious and error-prone if there are numerous key-value pairs to enter. Now, the Run Pipeline form will generate with pre-filled variables for your pipeline based on the variable definitions in your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file, making this process more efficient.
