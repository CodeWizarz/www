      description: |
        You can use the GitLab Dependency Proxy to proxy and cache container images from Docker Hub. Until recently the feature was only available for public groups, preventing many of you from being able to use it.

        You can now use the Dependency Proxy with private projects. You can reduce your reliance on Docker Hub by caching your container images for future use. Because the Dependency Proxy is storing Docker images in a space associated with your group, you must authenticate with your GitLab username and password, or with your personal access token with the scope set to at least `read_registry`.
