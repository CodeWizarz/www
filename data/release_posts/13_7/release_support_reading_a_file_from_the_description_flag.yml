      description: |
        If you [create releases in your pipelines via your project's `.gitlab-ci.yml` file](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/releases/index.html#release-cli-command-line), you've probably found it difficult to maintain each release's description. In GitLab 13.7, you can now define your release description in a source-controlled or auto-generated file and call it from `.gitlab-ci.yml`. Doing so loads the file's content into your release description as Markdown. This makes releases easier for you to create, maintain, and use with version control and is especially useful if you want to auto-generate your changelogs. Huge thanks to [Nejc Habjan](https://gitlab.com/nejch1) and Siemens for a great community contribution!
