        While prioritizing a list of issues in GitLab, it's often important to determine the critical path and whether an issue is blocking other issues.

        With the current issue list, it is impossible to see which issues are blocking other issues. The only way to do so is to open each one and see the [list of blockers](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues/2035) below the issue description, which is a very time-consuming task!

        As of 13.7, you can now use the filter for "Blocking" on any issue list, and you will see a list sorted by the number of blockers.
