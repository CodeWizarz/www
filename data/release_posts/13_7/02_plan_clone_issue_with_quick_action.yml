    description: |
      To make generating similar issues more efficient, issues now support a `/clone` quick action, which creates a new issue in the same project, with an identical title, description, and metadata. The `/clone` quick action replaces a more cumbersome process, which involves multiple steps to create an issue, copy the ID or path of the source issue, and use the `copy_meta` quick action.

      By default, issues are cloned into the same project and do not include system notes and comments, but you can also change the default behavior when cloning.
