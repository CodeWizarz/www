    description: |
      Asking a colleague to review your code should be a routine part of contributing code, but it's often needlessly complex. A simple task like asking for a review can lead to confusion. For example, how should you ask? An email? Comment? Chat message? Without a formal process, reviews can be inconsistent and hard to keep track of. Previously, an option was to assign a reviewer to a merge request, but even with this formality, both the author and the reviewer appeared in the same assignee field, making it hard for other team members to know who was doing what.

      GitLab 13.7 introduces reviewers for merge requests, which allows authors to request a review from someone. The new "Reviewers" field allows users to be designated as reviewers in a similar way to assignees. The reviewers receive a notification inviting them to review the merge request. This provides a formal process for requesting a review and clarifies the roles of each user in a merge request.

      Future iterations will include showing the most relevant reviewers for a merge request as well as a streamlined merge request approval flow that puts reviewers at the center. You can follow along in the [merge request reviewer assignment epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/1823) for more details.
