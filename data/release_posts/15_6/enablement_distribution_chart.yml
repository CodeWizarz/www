        -  Cloud Native GitLab will [replace `alpine-certificates` behaviors with `gitlab-base`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/-/issues/3446) in 15.7. To prevent differential behaviors between Alpine and Debian, and increase consistency across containers, we are going to build the pattern on `gitlab-base`. This means operational service containers will share a common root layer, which provides an efficiency boost to Pod instantiation time. The user impact of this change is that we will be changing the image name and tags used. We will maintain a mirrored tag for a brief period.
        - The [GitLab Helm Chart will have a new major version](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/charts/gitlab/-/issues/3442) release before the next major GitLab version, separate from the next major version as a whole. We are not sure when this next Helm chart major version will be released. Expect it no sooner than 2 milestones, and possibly longer. This was announced in 15.5. This major Helm chart release will require downtime, as we incorporate large updates and require manual intervention for upgrade paths.
