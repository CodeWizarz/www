    description: |
      The more complex your `.gitlab-ci.yml` configuration is, the more difficult it is to maintain and scale. By adding support for CI/CD variables with the `rules: exists` keyword, you can now use variables for paths or filenames. Having a single source of truth by storing frequently used values in variables ensures consistent behavior and makes your configuration easier to manage.
