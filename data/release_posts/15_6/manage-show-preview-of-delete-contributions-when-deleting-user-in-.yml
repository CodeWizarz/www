    description: |
      Previously, when you deleted a user and their contributions from the Admin area, it was not clear what and how many associated contributions were about to be deleted. Now, before proceeding with deleting a user, a confirmation message lists the number of groups, projects, issues, and merge requests associated with the user. This summary can help you prevent the accidental deletion of projects or subgroups.
