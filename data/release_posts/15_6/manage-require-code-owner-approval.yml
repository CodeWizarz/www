      When you import projects from GitHub to GitLab, GitHub branch protection rules that have an equivalent on GitLab are mapped to GitLab branch
      protection rules or project-wide GitLab settings:

        - GitHub rule **Require conversation resolution before merging for the project’s default branch** is mapped to the **All threads must be resolved**
          GitLab setting. 
        - GitHub rule **Require a pull request before merging** is mapped to the **No one** option in the **Allowed to push** list of the branch protection
          rule.
        - GitHub rule **Require a pull request before merging - Require review from Code Owners** is mapped to the **Code owner approval** branch protection
          rule. Requires GitLab Premium or higher.
        - GitHub rule **Require signed commits for the project’s default branch** is mapped to the **Reject unsigned commits** GitLab push rule.
          Requires GitLab Premium or higher.
        - GitHub rule **Allow force pushes - Everyone** is mapped to the **Allowed to force push** branch protection rule.
