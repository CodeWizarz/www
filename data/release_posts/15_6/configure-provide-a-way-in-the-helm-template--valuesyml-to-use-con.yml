    description: |
      The default Auto Deploy Helm chart now supports the `extraVolumes` and `extraVolumeMounts` options. In past releases, you could specify only [Persistent Volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#persistent-volumes) for Kubernetes. Among other use cases, you can now mount:

      - Secrets and ConfigMaps as files to Deployments, CronJobs, and Workers.
      - Existing or external Persistent Volumes Claims to Deployments, CronJobs, and Workers.
      - Private PKI CA certificates with hostPath mounts to achieve trust with the PKI.

      Thanks to [Maik Boltze](https://gitlab.com/MBcom) for this community contribution.
