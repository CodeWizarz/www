      description: |
        GitLab now supports managing scan result policies at both the group and subgroup levels. These policies automatically flow down and apply to all projects inside the group. This makes it considerably easier to enforce these policies uniformly for large organizations that have large numbers of projects. To get started, have a group or subgroup Owner link an associated security policy project on the **Security & Compliance > Policies** page.
