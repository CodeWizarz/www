    description: |
      Previously, the UI was required to update the access levels of protected
      branches. The API required you to unprotect, then reprotect, a branch when
      updating its access levels. Now, the 
      [protected branches API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/protected_branches.html#update-a-protected-branch)
      enables you to directly update which users or groups are `allowed_to_push`, `allowed_to_merge`,
      `allowed_to_unprotect`, and more. This one-step method decreases the risk of a bot
      changing this setting and leaving a branch unprotected.
