    description: |
      In this release, we are adding additional key information for multiple approval rules in the approval UI. Now during the workflow of approving a deployment, you can see who has already approved, as well as how many approvals are still needed and from which groups. This key information enables transparency and context for making the approval decision and also ensures compliance during an audit review.
