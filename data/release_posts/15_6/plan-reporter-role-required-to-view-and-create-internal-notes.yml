      Internal notes provide organizations with a way to manage internal communication in an issue or epic. We have improved support for this use case by ensuring users with the Guest role cannot create or view internal notes on GitLab issues and epics, even if they are the assignee or the author for that issue or epic. This provides organizations assurance that information in their internal notes will only be visible to members of their organization.
