    description: |
      Important links can end up buried in comments throughout your incident. We added [linked resources](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/operations/incident_management/linked_resources.html) in incidents in 15.3. In this release, you can use a quick action to add one or more linked resources to an incident.
