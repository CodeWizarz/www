        GitLab Static Analysis includes [many security analyzers](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#supported-languages-and-frameworks) that the GitLab Static Analysis team actively manages, maintains, and updates. The following analyzer updates were published during the 15.6 release milestone. These updates bring additional coverage, bug fixes, and improvements.

        - Gitleaks-based analyzer updated to version 8.15.0. See [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/secrets/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v452) for further details. This month, we also:
            - Fixed the rule for Slack webhook URLs.
        - KICS-based analyzer updated to version 1.6.2. See [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/kics/-/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v370) for further details. This month, we also:
            - Added new rules for CloudFormation and Terraform.
            - Addressed several false positive detections in existing rules. Findings from these rules will be marked ["No longer detected"](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/vulnerability_report/#activity-filter).
            - Changed the severity of some existing rules.
            - Fixed an issue where Info-level findings were incorrectly mapped to Unknown severity.
        - MobSF-based analyzer updated to version 3.6.0. See [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/mobsf/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v330) for further details.
        - PMD Apex-based analyzer updated to version 6.50.0. See [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/pmd-apex/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v330) for further details.
        - Semgrep-based analyzer updated to version 0.121.2. See [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/semgrep/-/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v390) for further details.
        - SpotBugs-based analyzer updated to version 4.7.3. See [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/spotbugs/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v331) for further details.
        
        If you [include the GitLab-managed SAST template](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#configure-sast-in-your-cicd-yaml) ([`SAST.gitlab-ci.yml`](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/lib/gitlab/ci/templates/Security/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml)), you don't need to do anything to receive these updates. However, if you override or customize your own CI/CD template, you need to update your CI/CD configurations.

        To remain on a specific version of any analyzer, you can [pin to a minor version of an analyzer](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/#pinning-to-minor-image-version). Pinning to a previous version prevents you from receiving automatic analyzer updates and requires you to manually bump your analyzer version in your CI/CD template.

        For previous changes, see [last month's updates](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/2022/10/22/gitlab-15-5-released/#static-analysis-analyzer-updates).
