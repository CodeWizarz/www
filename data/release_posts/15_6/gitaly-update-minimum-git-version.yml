    description: |
      The minimum required version of Git is now v2.37.0. This newer version has a lot of changes that we, and other Git community members, have made that
      provide a much better experience and resolve many issues, including:

      - Improved replication speed in `git-fetch`.
      - Improvements to `git-cat-file` which reduces the number of spawning processes needed.
      - An update that fixes corruption in Git references using the new `core.fsync` option.
      - A bugfix for `git-update-ref` which fixes flushing semantics so that we can properly lock references.
      - Support for cruft packs.
      - A new feature to compute merges in bare repositories with `git-merge-tree`.

        If you use a version of Git on your GitLab instance that is not bundled with GitLab, please ensure you upgrade to at least v2.37.0.
