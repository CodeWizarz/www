      description: |
        Users can now require Dependency Scanning to run on a regular schedule or as part of project CI pipelines, independent of the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file's contents. This allows security teams to manage these scan requirements separately without allowing developers to change the configuration. You can get started by creating a [scan execution policy](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/policies/scan-execution-policies.html) on the **Security & Compliance > Policies** page.
