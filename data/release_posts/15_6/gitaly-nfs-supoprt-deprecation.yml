  - title: "Removal of support for NFS as Git repository storage"
    description: |
      As of November 22, 2022, we are removing support for customers utilizing NFS for Git repository storage. This was originally planned for May 22, 2022, but in an effort to allow continued maturity of Gitaly Cluster, we chose to extend our removal of support date until now. Please see our official [Statement of Support](https://about.gitlab.com/support/statement-of-support/#gitaly-and-nfs) for further information.

      This change in our support follows the existing halt in development for NFS for Git repository storage that occurred in GitLab 14.0.

      Gitaly Cluster offers tremendous benefits for our customers such as:

      - [Variable replication factors](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/gitaly/index.html#replication-factor).
      - [Strong consistency](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/gitaly/index.html#strong-consistency).
      - [Distributed read capabilities](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/gitaly/index.html#distributed-reads).

      We encourage customers currently using NFS for Git repositories to migrate as soon as possible by reviewing our
      documentation on [migrating to Gitaly Cluster](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/gitaly/index.html#migrate-to-gitaly-cluster).
