    description: |
      You can now make calls against the GraphQL API as if all deprecated items were already removed. To make these calls, add the new `remove_deprecated=true` query parameter to the GitLab GraphQL API endpoint. This way, you can verify your API calls against the GraphQL schema without the deprecated schema items.
