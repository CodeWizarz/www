    description: |
      Previously, it was difficult to use the `$` character in a CI/CD variable because `$` normally signifies the start of another variable. GitLab would interpret it as a variable and try to expand it. In this release, we are introducing the `variable: expand:` keyword which will allow you to mark a variable as "raw". A raw variable can contain any special characters and is not expanded when passed to the GitLab runner.
