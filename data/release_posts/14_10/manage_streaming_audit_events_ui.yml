    description: |
      You can now use the GitLab UI to set up [streaming audit events](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/audit_event_streaming.html) in your groups! Access it under the new **Streams** tab in the group audit events page.

      This screen makes it easy to:

      - Add and remove streaming audit event destinations.
      - See the list of locations streaming audit events are being sent to.

      Thank you to Jeremy Wu from [JiHu](https://www.gitlab.cn/) for this contribution!
