      In every release, we continue to make great strides improving the performance of GitLab. We're committed to making every GitLab instance faster. This includes GitLab.com, an instance with over 1 million registered users!

      In GitLab 14.10, we're shipping performance improvements for issues, projects, milestones, and much more! Some improvements in GitLab 14.10 are:

      - [Asynchronous SAML membership updates](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/343460).
      - [Preload group root ancestor for Group Projects API](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/330140).
