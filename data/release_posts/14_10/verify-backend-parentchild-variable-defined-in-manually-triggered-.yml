    description: |
      Previously, it was possible to pass some CI/CD variables to a downstream pipeline through a trigger job, but variables added in manual pipeline runs or by using the API could not be forwarded.

      In this release we've added a new `trigger:forward` keyword to control what things you forward to downstream parent-child pipelines or multi-project pipelines, which provides a flexible way to handle variable inheritance in downstream pipelines.
