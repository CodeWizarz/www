      description: |
        In GitLab 13.10, we [released](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gl-openshift/gitlab-runner-operator/-/issues/6) the GitLab Runner Operator for the Red Hat OpenShift container platform for Kubernetes. That release provided OpenShift users with the automation and management capabilities of the Operator Framework and simplified the ongoing management of runners in an OpenShift Kubernetes cluster. Available starting in 14.10 is a GitLab Runner Operator v1.7.0 that you can use in non-OpenShift Kubernetes clusters. This GitLab Runner Operator is available on [OperatorHub.io](https://operatorhub.io/operator/gitlab-runner-operator).
