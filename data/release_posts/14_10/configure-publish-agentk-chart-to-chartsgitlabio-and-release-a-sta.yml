    description: |
      The GitLab agent for Kubernetes has a component
      that needs to be installed into the user cluster. Previously, we provided a
      Docker-based one-liner installer and a Kpt-based advanced installation
      method. As Helm is an often requested method for installing Kubernetes applications, 
      we are replacing the Docker-based installer with a Helm package.

      Thanks to [Eamonn McCudden's (@emctl)](https://gitlab.com/emctl) contribution, the GitLab agent for Kubernetes can
      be installed into a user cluster from a Helm package. This facilitates the installation
      of the agent into the cluster as well as automating with Terraform.
      We have replaced the Docker-based
      installation method with the new Helm package as we expect users to have
      `helm` installed on the local machines.

      The Helm package exists on both the
      [charts.gitlab.io](https://charts.gitlab.io/) and [ArtifactHUB](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/gitlab/gitlab-agent) repositories.
