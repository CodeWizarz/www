    description: |
      Vulnerability Management in GitLab processes and aggregates security findings from our many Secure scanners, and can seamlessly incorporate results from integrated 3rd-party scanners. While this provides valuable security information in a unified experience, it limits Vulnerability Management to only those vulnerabilities picked up by currently supported tools.

      We're introducing the ability to manually create vulnerability records to greatly expand the use cases Vulnerability Management can handle. Leveraging our recently-released ability to [create vulnerability records through the API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/graphql/reference/#mutationvulnerabilitycreate), making a new vulnerability record is as simple as entering a few required pieces of information. With manually created vulnerability records you can provide additional details supported by vulnerability records, including the severity, identifiers and suggested solution. You can view manually created records in the Group, Project, and Security Center Vulnerability Reports. And you can move records through your triage and remediation workflows like you would any scanner-detected vulnerability.
