    description: |
      Previously, if you wanted to create a pipeline schedule for tags, you had to use the API. The simpler method of using the pipeline schedules UI could only be used for branches.

      Now, when you use the pipeline schedules UI, you can choose from either branches or tags as needed, and no longer need to use the API! Thanks [@KevSlashNull](https://gitlab.com/KevSlashNull) for this contribution!
