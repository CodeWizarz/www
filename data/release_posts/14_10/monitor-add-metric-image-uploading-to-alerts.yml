    description: |
      GitLab 13.2 introduced the [metrics tab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/operations/incident_management/alerts.html#metrics-tab) in GitLab alerts. However, with the deprecation of [GitLab Managed Apps](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/clusters/applications.html) and alerts on the Metrics page, metrics no longer automatically populate on new alerts and are difficult to support on old ones. This release completes the deprecation of the old metrics functionality, and introduces the ability to add a screenshot to alerts, similar to how screenshots can be added to [incidents](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/operations/incident_management/incidents.html#metrics). Having a screenshot of the metric that triggered the alert helps responders triage alerts more efficiently.
