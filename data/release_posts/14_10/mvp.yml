    Jeremy added a [user interface](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/audit_event_streaming.html#use-the-gitlab-ui) for
    [streaming audit events](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/audit_event_streaming.html) to GitLab
    that provides an easy way for users, including non-technical users, to get
    started with streaming audit events, rather than needing to use the API.

    Thanks to this contribution, users can now easily add and remove streaming audit
    event destinations as well as see the list of existing streaming audit event
    destinations.

    Great work! Thank you, Jeremy! ðŸ™Œ
