    description: |
     In this release, we have added the fourth DORA metric API, change failure rate. GitLab measures the change failure rate as the number of [incidents](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/operations/incident_management/incidents.html) divided by the number of deployments to a production environment in the given time period.
     The [DORA metrics](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/using-the-four-keys-to-measure-your-devops-performance) enable executives who are investing in DevOps transformation to understand ROI on processes they are implementing and tools they have purchased. Changes in these metrics easily become KPIs for those teams.
