    description: |
      The `include` keyword is one of the most popular ones to use when writing a full CI/CD pipeline. If you are building larger pipelines, you
      are probably using the `include` keyword to bring external YAML configuration into your pipeline.

      In this release, we are expanding the power of the keyword so you can use include with `exists` in the rules condition. Now, you
      can decide when external CI/CD configuration should or shouldnâ€™t be included based on when certain files exist in the repository.
