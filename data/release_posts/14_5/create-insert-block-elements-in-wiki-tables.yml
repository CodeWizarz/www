    description: |
      GitLab 14.1 introduced WYSIWYG editing for tables in the new wiki editor, but the types of content supported in table cells were limited by the underlying Markdown implementation: you couldn't add block-level elements like lists, code blocks, or pull quotes inside a table. Now, in GitLab 14.5, these block-level elements are fully supported inside table cells. You can insert lists, code blocks, paragraphs, headings, and even nested tables inside a table cell, giving you more flexibility and freedom to format your content to meet your needs.
