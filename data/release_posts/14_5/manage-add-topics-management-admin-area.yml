      In this release, thanks to [Jonas WÃ¤lter's](https://gitlab.com/wwwjon) contributions, we've introduced several features for administrators to manage project topics in the Admin Area:

      - Add and edit project topics.
      - Search topics based on any string.
      - Add avatars and descriptions to topics (supports Markdown).
