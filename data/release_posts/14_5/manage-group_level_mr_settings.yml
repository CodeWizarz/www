    description: |
      You can now define and enforce values for merge request approval settings at the group level.
      These values cascade and are used by any projects within the group.

      Group-level merge request approvals make it easy for organizations to ensure proper separation of duties across all teams. You only have to
      specify settings in a single location now, rather than needing to update and monitor every project. When set at the group level, you:

      - Can be confident that projects will use consistent separation of duties workflows.
      - Do not need to manually check that every project has not had its settings modified.
