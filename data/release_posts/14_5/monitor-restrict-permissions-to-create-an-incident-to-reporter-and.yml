    description: |
      You may have experienced a time where you created an incident when you actually meant to create an issue. Incidents are a specific issue-type, with a unique user interface and workflow that represent service disruptions or outages. In this release, only users with at least the Reporter role can create incidents. Restricting these permissions will help minimize the number of accidentally-created incidents.
