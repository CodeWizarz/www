    description: |
      In this release, thanks to [Jonas WÃ¤lter's](https://gitlab.com/wwwjon) contributions, adding topics in project settings is easier than ever. Previously, to add a topic, you had to manually enter each topic and multiple topics had to be comma-separated.
      Now you can select multiple topics from a dropdown list, making topic selection efficient and more convenient.
