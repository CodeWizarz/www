    description: |
      Jupyter notebooks are key to data scientists' and machine learning engineers' workflows, but the file structure makes code review challenging. Often, the files can't be reviewed properly, and users are forced to accept those changes or treat their repositories as stores of data versus collaborative projects.

      Now GitLab automatically strips out the noise and displays a cleaner version of the diff for these files. Human-readable diffs make it easier to review the substance of the change, without worrying about the formatting pieces that Jupyter Notebooks need.
