    description: |
      Currently, when you POST an alert using the generic alert HTTP Endpoint the response is a simple 200 upon a successful POST. If you want to reconcile your current alert workflows, you may need to see additional information returned in the POST response. In this release, we added the alert ID (`iid`) to the response, enabling you to see your specific alerts by a unique ID.
