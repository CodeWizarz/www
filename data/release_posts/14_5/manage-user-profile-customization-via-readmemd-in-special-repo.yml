      You can now add a README section to your GitLab profile! This is a great way to tell
      others about, your interests, how you work,
      or anything else you want!

      To add a README section, create a new public project with the same name as your user account and add a new
      [README file](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/index.html#readme-and-index-files). The contents
      of that file are automatically shown on your GitLab profile.
