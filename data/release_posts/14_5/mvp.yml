    Jonas has been a long-time contributor to GitLab, working along GitLab team members at complex changes to [group-level authentication apps](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/oauth_provider.html#group-owned-applications), and in 14.5, he has made another stellar contribution to improve [project topics](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/328226). He created over **22 merge requests** to enable a separation of topics from tags in GitLab.

    While implementing project topics, Jonas ran into a blocker. To enable topics, he had to move the topics out of the tags table in the database. Jonas's [Sharding contribution](https://gitlab.com/
    gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/335946) also unblocked the Sharding group's efforts.
    Way to go Jonas! üëè
