    description: |
      Tracking the status of a running pipeline can involve significant context switching because you sometimes have to stop what you are doing to go check the pipeline page. Previously, the pipeline editor only showed the overall pipeline status and provided a link to the pipeline. In this release, we are adding the pipeline mini graph to the pipeline editor to make it easier for you to see the status of individual jobs without leaving the editor.
