    description: |
      In this release, thanks to [Jonas WÃ¤lter's](https://gitlab.com/wwwjon) contributions, we've added a new **Explore topics** tab in **Projects**.

      - Topics are sorted by popularity (the number of projects with this topic).
      - Topics can be searched by name and are then sorted by similarity and by popularity.

      When you select a topic, you can view its description and avatar, and all of its corresponding projects.
