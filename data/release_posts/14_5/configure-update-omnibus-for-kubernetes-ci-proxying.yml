    description: |
      The CI/CD Tunnel support for self-managed instances installed through GitLab Charts was introduced in 14.0 and significantly improved since then. In this release, we are adding support for Omnibus installations.

      The CI/CD Tunnel provides a secure connection from within GitLab CI/CD to your Kubernetes clusters using the GitLab Agent for Kubernetes. This enables users to continue using their existing tools and processes, and adopt the Agent for a robust and safe setup.
