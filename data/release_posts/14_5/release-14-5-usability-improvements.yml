      In every release, we make great strides in improving the overall effectiveness and usefulness of our product.

      We also have a [UI Polish Gallery](https://nicolasdular.gitlab.io/gitlab-polish-gallery/) to track important updates to our interfaces. These updates, while often small, improve your user experience.

      In GitLab 14.5, we're shipping usability improvements for issues, projects, milestones, and much more! We highlight the following changes in GitLab 14.5:
