story: 'Robert is a by-the-numbers guy, which is why he loves spending his days looking
  at, tweaking, and improving marketing numbers and metrics. He finds great joy in
  seeing a plan or a spreadsheet come together. When the work day is over, Robert
  finds himself traveling, exploring the outdoors, tinkering in his garage, and pursuing
  an eclectic grouping of other hobbies.
