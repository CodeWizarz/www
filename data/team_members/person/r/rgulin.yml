story: Raquel started her international experience in 2006 stepping in Switzerland
  to study Global Hospitality Management and since then she didnâ€™t stop. She is a
  global citizen with a series of different skills, but above all, she has the right
  attitude and carries on great team spirit. There is not much free time left on her
  day as she makes sure to keep herself busy being a mom of two furry Persian cats,
  following courses online, restoring furniture, keeping up with sports, and planning
  a lot of weekend trips!
