story: 'Radovan is a truly passionate data geek and he is very obsessive about acquiring
  knowledge regarding modern data platforms and other hot tech topics. Mainly, keep
  a focus on modern data (ETL/ELT) processing approaches, transformation, and data
  representation. Living, working, and enjoying in Novi Sad, Serbia, a nice and cozy
  city on the Danube river. The vast majority of free time spend on the mat practicing
  Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and Luta Livre. Very keen and thrilled about traveling, meeting
  new people, cycling, running, sailing (still on a very beginner level, but really
  like it), and enjoying outdoor activities despite the weather. Here''s a link to
