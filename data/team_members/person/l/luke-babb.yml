story: "I joined GitLab in 2016 as the sole Brand Designer and haven't looked back
  since! I enjoy creating meaningful and engaging experiences through visuals - 'Making
  it pop!' since 2009. \n\nI am incredibly grateful for GitLab's all-remote culture
  which enables me to be a work-from-home Dad to my two amazing children (who often
  frequent GitLab calls as background noise). For fun I enjoy hockey (Go Avs!), getting
  a (sweaty) hour to myself at Orangetheory Fitness, and spending time with my family.\n"
