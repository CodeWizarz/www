story: Loryn has a passion for solving product problems in complex spaces. She loves
  getting to deep dive into customer and user contexts - especially those she has
  little first hand experience with. In the course of her career (so far) this includes
  learning a lot about tax compliance and how fiber optic networks get built. Outside
  of work Loryn is a runner (both of trails and after her two small children) and
  a coffee nerd.
