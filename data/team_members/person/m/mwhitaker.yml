story:  I have been in the professional IT space for 6+ years and enjoy working with fast growing, progressive companyâ€™s IT departments in automating their processes, masterfully administrating applications, and creating a positive customer experience for end users. All with the end goal of creating a more zero trust security posture that enables everyone to be more safe, successful and efficient. I live in Atlanta, GA and love cycling, rock climbing, backpacking, and travel.
