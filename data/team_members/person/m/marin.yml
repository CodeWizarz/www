story: |
  Marin loves to develop in Rails but has also grown an interest in operations, release and development workflows.
  When video conferencing with him you get a cat running across the room as a bonus.
  He is notorious for starting early in the morning just after breakfast and not having lunch until his workday is over.
  You would expect him to be hungry and grumpy the last few hours but as long as his internet connection is up he is always friendly and upbeat.
  He loves travelling and talking about politics. Here's a link to Marin's <a href="/handbook/engineering/readmes/marin-jankovski/">README</a>.
