story: |
  Matthias has been working with computers since he first made ASCII based treasure maps as a kid in the mid-80s.
  Realizing that there's no career in treasure maps, he started to direct his attention to more promising pursuits,
  such as mobile application development, backend development, and a personal video game that he is unlikely to ever finish.
  Outside of work he likes to go on walks, watch Netflix with his wife and cat, and play Xbox.
