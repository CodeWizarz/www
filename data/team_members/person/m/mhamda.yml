story: |
  Mohamed loves challenges where he can put effort into gaining knowledge, not just in programming which he loves, but also in life.
  He is always trying to discover a new country, culture, or learn a new language.
  He loves getting to know new people, helping others, and spreading that attitude to the world.
  He likes playing football/soccer, running, hiking, or trying new activities.
  You can always find him in a city with a minimum of 30Â°C in summer, but in winter, it depends!
