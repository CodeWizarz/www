story: |
  Though an astrophysicist by training, Mark decided to pursue a career where
  he had a bit more agency, and which measured timescales in days rather than
  billions of years. Frontend development seemed a perfect fit, where Mark
  enjoys writing correct, pragmatic and simple user interfaces. He loves to
  ski, travel, eat good food, and generally contemplate just how good dogs
  are.
