story: |
  Mike does not identify with one particular job title. He has tried his hands at different specialisations over his career, and is interested in the learning journey, not the destination.<br>
  He believes his experience in development, operations, and testing, make him especially equipped to understand the complexity of modern software systems.<br>
  He enjoys nature (especially the beach), good food, travel, and music.
remote_story: 'Like many others, COVID-19 forced me to work remotely. From the first
  day, I was a convert. I believe that many types of jobs can benefit from remote
  work. I am incredibly excited to be working remotely and asynchronously at GitLab!
