story: Gregory is a backend software engineer from South Africa with a penchant for
  raucous laughter and silly jokes. As one of the first alumni from 2016 WeThinkCode_
  cohort, he enjoys sharing his knowledge and mentoring new developers when possible.
  When he's not writing code, you can usually find him playing video games, watching
  nerdy science documentaries or travelling about.
