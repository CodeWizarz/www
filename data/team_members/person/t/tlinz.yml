story: Torsten started his career at a Fraunhofer research institute in Berlin and
  earned a doctoral degree in electrical engineering from Ghent University. As a product
  manager at HERE Technologies, he built a SaaS platform to simplify the development
  of location-based services and applications. At GitLab he started out leading the
  product management for the Source Code Management Category. Currently, he works
  as a product manager in the AI Framework group. He spends his free-time sailing
  and wing foiling the lakes of Berlin and convincing his family to join him - with
  little success.
