  Meet Tania, a former academic turned platform engineer and tabletop nerd.
  When not working, she's either DMing, painting plastic miniatures, attempting to get a tabletop game going, playing video games or lindy hopping.
  If there was an award for too many dice, she would be a strong contender with her Bailey-esque hoard. She's still working on her math-click-clack impulse control.
