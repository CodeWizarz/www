story: |
  Tan has always been fascinated with software engineering - a beautiful
  intersection of art and science. He loves elegant codes, simple systems and
  the magic of human collaboration. Outside of work, you will probably find him
  tinkering with mechanical keyboards, reading random comics, exploring the
  AI/ML universe or growing things in his humble garden.
