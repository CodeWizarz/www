story: "I’m from a small mountain town in central Europe. I love software design and
  enjoy the struggle of making it a good one. In my career, I’ve been oscillating
  between backend and frontend, leadership and individual roles. I consider myself
  a generalist and enjoy any puzzle that comes my way, be it a DB query optimization,
  designing a new system, or, more recently, working with editor extensions. \nWhen
  my work laptop is closed,  I read, <a href=\"https://blog.viktomas.com\">write</a>,
  or explore the outdoors and the mountains. "
