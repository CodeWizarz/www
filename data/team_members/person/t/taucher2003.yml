story: |
  Niklas first used Git and GitLab in January 2020 and started administering two self-managed instances in February 2021.
  In September 2021, he started to actively contribute to GitLab and joined the GitLab Heroes in November that year.
  After some more time he joined the core team in February 2023.

  His interests are mostly in the area of automation tooling and CI/CD pipelines, but he also thinks that GitLab all around is very interesting.
