story: |
  Tetiana became a GitLab user in 2015 and she joined the team almost 4 years after.
  She is interested in security and secretly obsessed with math statistics.
  In her spare time, Tetiana grows herbs and vegetables in her balcony garden,
  learns new languages, cooks, paints in watercolor and reads books.
  If she is lucky and there is snow outside, she enjoys riding a snowboard.
