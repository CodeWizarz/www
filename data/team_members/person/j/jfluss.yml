story: Originally from the Bay Area, but now residing in Austin, I love to swim, surf
  (Encinitas is the best) and ski (learned at Stevens Pass). I attended UC Santa Cruz
  (Go Slugs!) and University of Texas at Austin (Hook'em!), two very different, yet
  fulfilling experiences. You can find me Saturday morning at my local coffee shop
  reading the WSJ front to back. Ask me anything you'd like about investing and the
  markets, I'd love to turn your two minute question into an hour long discussion.
