story: I began my career right after University, delving into web development & video
  content management. As I explored the field further, I shifted my focus to CMS platforms
  and open-source technologies, immersing myself in coding and development. After
  gaining several years of experience as a developer, I made a pivotal transition
  into sales development. My journey in sales initially specialized in the Data space
  of business development, leveraging my expertise in data visualization. Over time,
  I expanded my focus to encompass Cloud technologies, Application Development, and
  DevOps. As a sales leader, I have achieved remarkable success both professionally
  and personally over the past decade. Throughout my career, I have cultivated a strong
  work ethic and a relentless passion for continuous growth. With an unwavering commitment
  to excellence, I approach each professional endeavor with dedication and an insatiable
  hunger for learning.
