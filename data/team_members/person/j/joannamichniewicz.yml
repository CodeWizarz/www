story: 'Joanna is a Recruiter who joined GitLab in January 2020. She resides in the
  city of Gda≈Ñsk with her two fluffs - Dakota and Baloo. When she is not attracting
  the best talent worldwide, you can probably find her biking to the seaside, hiking
  in the woods, doing yoga, reading books or playing board games with her nerdy friends.
  GitLab gives her the flexibility she always dreamed of in order to perform her work
  the best way she can while traveling the world.
