story: I am a member of the Sales Leadership Team covering Enterprise accounts in
  the Pac NW and Midwest.  I love developer productivity and helping companies get
  value to production faster and with lower risk.  GitLab is a great place to pursue
  those goals.   I am married to Linda and have two great teenage girls Caroline and
  Grace.   I love Viking football, playing cards, classic arcade games and enjoying
  the lakes here in Minnesota.
