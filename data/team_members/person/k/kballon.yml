story: 'Kent loves helping others understand and solve technical problems. Prior to
  joining GitLab he worked in the Hardware Engineering industry before switching to
  the IT/Software Engineering industry, building up skills to be a jack of all trades.
  When he is not chasing any rabbitholes, he likes to spend time playing video games,
  or honing his mediocre piano skills, or slicing up a lot of garlic and cooking different
  dishes.
