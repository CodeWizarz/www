story: 'German "Vorsprung durch Technik" paired with Russian "soul". I don''t sell,
  I don''t market... I help. My passion lies within bringing the right people together
  for the maximum benefit for all parties. Seeing people succeed, is what really drives
  me. My other happy places that make me feel alive are dancing, attending live music
  gigs and travelling to new places.
