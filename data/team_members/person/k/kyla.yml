story: 'Hailing from the Great Plains of North Dakota, where winters are colder than
  Antarctica (it feels like) and accents are less noticeable than the movie Fargo.
  Kyla has seven years of experience in software technology sales, before joining
  the GitLab team, she acquired most of her experience working at a global technology
  organization, where she dedicated much of her time to the cloud platform and infrastructure.
  Outside of GitLab she enjoys traveling, playing tennis, and spending summers on
  the water with family and friends. GitLab''s slice of North Dakota nice.
