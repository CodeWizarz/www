story: 'I have always been more interested in what happens backstage that creates
  and supports what everyone sees up front. Always seeking to understand how things
  work, I enjoy modifying and repurposing hardware and software in order to create
  interesting and fully customized products and experiences. My background as a system
  implementation and network engineer allow me to do this in a myriad of environments.
  Outside of work I enjoy exploring the outdoors with my wife, playing music, and
  learning new things from new people. '
