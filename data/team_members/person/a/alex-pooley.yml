story: |
  Alex taught himself to code instead of doing homework. Fortunately that "Internet" thing worked out and a couple of decades later he is still able to build innovative web applications for a living.
  When AFK Alex enjoys spending time with his family, exercise, bouldering, and nerding out on business and finance.
