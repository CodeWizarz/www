story: |
  Andrew spent 17 years living in London before returning home to Cape Town in South Africa.
  Before joining GitLab, Andrew cofounded <a href="https://gitter.im">Gitter</a>
  where he was the CTO. Married with two kids, he spends what little spare time he has
  tinkering with machine-learning, building contraptions of questionable usefulness.
  Away from technology, his passions are travel, photography, motorcycling and the
  great outdoors.
