story: |
  André is a self-described web nerd who grew up with the web. He has a twin brother but (he says) he's not the evil one.
  Loves bridging the world of Design and Engineering with accessibility in mind. While on breaks from that, he brews coffee with an Aeropress,
  enjoys mountain biking, binge-watches every standup comedy special and is thrilled by landscape and architectural photography,
  especially when done at night.
