story: |
  As a software engineer, Andreas has been straddling the line between development and infrastructure roles in startup environments.
  Before joining the Scalability group, he focused on database engineering and worked from GitLab's database group in development and as a Database Reliability Engineer for GitLab.com.
  Away from the keyboard, you'll find him in a dockyard refitting a steel cruising ketch (a sailboat), welding in his workshop or cooking in the kitchen.
  He enjoys being around water on a sailboat, as part of the deck crew on a German tall ship, in a kayak or when diving.
