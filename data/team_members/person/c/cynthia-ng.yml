remote_story: 'GitLab has changed the way I think about remote work. While I have
  worked remote before, a lot of work was still done synchronously and in an office
  part time. At GitLab, work is much more flexible because so much is done asynchronously.
  Being a global company also means that I can also work in other locations, allowing
  me to visit friends and family in other locations. At the same time, it has allowed
  me to live outside a big city, and spend more time with local family and friends
  when not travelling.
