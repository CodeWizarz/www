story: |
  Chad has been doing coding, sysadmin, and ops for 30+ years, since the dawn
  of the web and before - from mainframes to the cloud. He has contributed to and
  created several open source projects. His hobbies include traveling, volunteering,
  learning Spanish, listening to and making music, and weightlifting/natural bodybuilding.
  Chad joined GitLab because their values are closely aligned with his own, and he believes in
  an all-remote culture. He is a happy user of the GitLab product for his own personal projects. A
  note on areas of "expertise" listed: "I'll never really consider myself an 'expert' in anything,
  but that's the nature of imposter syndrome and moving right on the Dunning-Kruger curve. I do know
  a few things about the topics of expertise I've listed, though (as well as many more), and at a
  minimum I can find someone else to ask ;)"
