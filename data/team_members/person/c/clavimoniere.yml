story: Chad is a product designer with over a decade of experience creating delightful
  and intuitive experiences for users with complex business needs. When he's not at
  work, some of the things he's learning about these days are how to play the violin,
  how to make great backyard pizza, growing a pollinator garden, watercolor painting,
  and keeping an urban sketch notebook.
