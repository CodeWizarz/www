story: Christine is a problem solver who enjoys collaborating with cross-functional
  teams to achieve results, and she is excited to do this at GitLab as part of the
  Chief of Staff to the CEO team. Prior to joining GitLab, she led the Business Consulting
  and Analytics team at Bloomreach, and before that she was a strategy consultant
  in Accenture's technology industry group. She has a B.S. in Materials Science from
  MIT, where she realized she wasn't as good at math as she thought she was. Originally
  from Atlanta, Georgia, Christine now lives in San Jose, California with her partner
  and two pet bunnies, Cinnabun and Teddy. Outside of work, she enjoys cooking, listening
  to podcasts, hiking, traveling, gardening, and trying to find more space for her
