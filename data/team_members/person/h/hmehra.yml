story: "I enjoy being involved in all aspects of product development - strategy, architecture,
  coding, security and customer support. The chance to learn something new everyday
  and solve a problem gets me out of bed in the morning. I was born and brought up
  \  in India, but I moved to Melbourne at 17 to build an independent life for myself.
  I love cooking, eating, reading true-crime stories and taking spontaneous road trips.
  \n"
