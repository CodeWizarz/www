story: Dylan recently graduated from the University of the Pacific with his M.S. in
  Business Analytics and B.S. in Applied Math. He became passionate about coding and
  development after a few coding courses in college. Anytime he is not in front of
  a computer, he is doing everything he can to stay active; that often includes playing
  pickleball a few times a week, running, swimming, surfing in the summer, and snowboarding
