story: "Customizing the HTML and CSS of my MySpace profile introduced me to programming
  at a young age. Later on, my curiosity with human-computer interaction grew, and
  lead me to pursue a career in digital analytics. I’ve helped organizations across
  different industries set up their web analytics tool in order to improve their digital
  experience and marketing presence. When I’m not analyzing data sets, you can catch
  me paddle boarding with my dog, playing tennis, woodworking, or completely transform
  into a couch potato watching the latest A24 movie. \n"
