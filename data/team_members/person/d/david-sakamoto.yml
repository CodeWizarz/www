  Obispo, David started his professional career at Silicon Graphics Inc (SGI) where
  he was a Process Engineer and eventually a Program Manager, leading the release
  for high-end servers, supercomputers and MIPs processors. From there, he served
  in an diverse collection of roles and companies, including Software Program Manager
  (Genentech/biotech), Professional Services (XUMA / startup), Sales Engineering /
  Professional Services / Support / SW QA / Maintenance (CITTIO / startup), Success
  Operations / Software Development / Customer Success (Cisco), Customer Success /

  He is thankful to live in beautiful San Francisco a couple blocks from Ocean Beach
  where he occasionally surfs. He''s blessed to have a wonderful wife, two delightfully
  exuberant twin boys and a rambuncious shephard mix (Mister Syd). He also really
  loves tacos.
