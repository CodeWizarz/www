story: |
  I'm a listener, a story teller, an agilist, a part time runner, an avid college football fan and loyal husband and friend.
  I like to look at life like a Choose Your Own Adventure book. Make your own way, but most importantly, have fun while doing it.
  If you can find like-minded people to share your adventure with, you've already won.

  I enjoy bad puns, making people laugh and especially learning new things.
  Also, there's not a home project that I won't attempt at least once.
  Smile, learn something new today and if you can, make a new friend.
