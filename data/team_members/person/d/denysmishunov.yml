story: 'Denys is a developer, sometimes <a href="https://speaking.mishunov.me/">a
  public speaker</a> and occasionally <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/author/denys-mishunov/">a
  writer</a>. Being 2-in-1: an art school graduate and an engineer, Denys is passionate
  about psychology, physics, history, drawing. In his day-to-day job he enjoys getting
  to the heart of the matter of things and processes. Originally from “CSS side”,
  for the last years Denys has been building Javascript applications, still breaking
  CSS, abusing HTML and working with performance optimisations of pretty much all
  aspects of the front-end toolset.
