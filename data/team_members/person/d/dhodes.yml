story: Dan is originally from New Jersey but has lived in Overland Park, Kansas since
  2008, as he and his wife have welcomed a son, a daughter, and a dachshund in that
  time. He joins GitLab after nearly two decades as an attorney specializing in litigation
  and risk management, most recently at a leading cybersecurity company.  When not
  spending time with his family, Dan enjoys general success with crossword puzzles,
  some success with CrossFit, and very limited success trying to pick winners of golf
  tournaments.
