story: 'Josh''s passion with computers started in elementary school when his parents
  brought an IBM PCjr home along with a book on BASIC. In his teenage years he spent
  time working on a variety of coding projects and assembling his own computers. He
  developed a love for product management 6 years ago, while working on a solution
  in the mobile productivity space. When not spending time with his family or working
  on technology, he tries to get out skiing and playing tennis.
