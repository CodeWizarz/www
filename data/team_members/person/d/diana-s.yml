  Before joining GitLab, Diana ran a large GitLab installation. She has a long background in
  support and Dev Ops, in companies large and small. She loves a good puzzle. In her free
  time she takes a lot of garment fitting and sewing workshops, and is the slave to two dogs
  and two cats at home.
