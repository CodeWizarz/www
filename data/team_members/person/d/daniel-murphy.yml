story: Grateful to be a founding member of GitLab's Contributor Success team. I like
  solving problems and supporting other people. As an open source maintainer, I help
  grow communities and work with contributors. I love developing in Ruby on Rails
  but also enjoy working cross functionally with other teams. My life has evolved
  from my dedication to personal development, volunteering and hypertrophy training.
