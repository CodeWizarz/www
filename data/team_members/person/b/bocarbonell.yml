story: Bo is a jack of all trades with skills ranging from sketch artist, musician,
  and martial artist to network engineering and most trades in construction. Bo thinks
  it is important to know he is not a master at most of his skills, but loves learning
  them. When he is not learning new things, Bo loves to be away from technology and
  populace to join nature in the wondrous outdoors where he loves to do as much of
  nothing as possible. Preferably, with family whom he considers top priority.
