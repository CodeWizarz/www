story: Bronwyn has a deep passion for data privacy both personally and professionally. A naturally curious and analytic individual with motivation to solve for "x," she enjoys the iterations, growth opportunities and challenges for GitLab as data privacy laws evolve around the world. Even outside of work, you will still find her reading about privacy enhancing technologies and staying on top of what is happening in block chain and smart contracts. Bronwyn is a woodworker and loves crafting in general to unplug and calm the mind.
