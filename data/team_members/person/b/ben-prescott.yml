  Outside work, he enjoys spending time with his wife and daughter, getting tasty things to grow in the garden, cycling, reading, and photography.
  Ben's been in front of a computer keyboard since his childhood, when it had a cassette recorder built into it, and is still learning with Linux, and an installation of GitLab, at home.
