story: |
  Praba hails from a small town in India and studied Software engineering by luck,
  but fell in love with programming languages (and general tech) and the logics behind them.
  Outside of work he likes to run and read about finance, philosophy & biographies.
  Also he believes remote is the (present and) future!
