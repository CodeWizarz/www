story: |
  Patrick is a software engineer with a love for open source software
  in general and the Git and Linux ecosystems in particular. He loves
  tinkering around with components in the low-level userspace and
  bending operating systems to his will, often until they break. In his
  free time, he regularly visits fitness and bouldering gyms, plays
  badminton or goes for a swim.
