story: Sarah is Irish and joins GitLab with 15 years of experience as a paralegal
  (working as a legal knowledge and information specialist - across most commercial
  practice areas). Based in Dublin, beside the sea, when sheâ€™s not in the water or
  working, Sarah can be found chasing her two small kids, two small dogs and regular
  sized husband around, taking breaks to do yoga and drink tea.
