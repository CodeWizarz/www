story: |
  Sheldon likes to have a beginner's mindset, positive attitude, and curiosity to everything in life!
  He loves frontend but really likes all things web development.
  Sheldon also likes to listen to podcasts, watch YouTube/Netflix/etc, cook, run,
  drink coffee and beer, and swim in the cold Irish Sea whenever the weather allows it (still building resistance).
  He enjoys spending quality time with his wife, friends, to travel, explore new stuff,
  and is up for a good chat about pretty much anything.
  Led stands for Light Emitting Diode, and is part of his name for real!
