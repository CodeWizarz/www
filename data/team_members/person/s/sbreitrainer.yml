story: "Stephan has built and maintained infrastructures for various companies over
  the past years.\nWhen not working or tinkering with home automation and too many
  Raspberry Pis\nhe loves to cook and try out new recipes. Not being much of a morning-person
  and living the coffee-free way\nof life, you'll usually meet him with a cup of Matcha.\nAnd
  as a father of a toddler he knows a trick or two how to deal with unpredictable
  situations or \nwhen it's best to just let go.\n"
