story: 'Simon has a background in software engineering, solutions architecture and
  now, is a member of a customer success leadership team. He lives in the middle of
  rural Somerset, having spent nearly 18 years in Wales (despite not being Welsh).
  When he''s not at his desk chatting away to GitLab team members or customers, he
  can be found clinging onto exposed rockfaces, cycling, playing a board games with
  friends or, more likely, watching his favourite NFL team lose on TV. Simon has a
  beautiful wife, a bengal cat and a very active toddler! '
