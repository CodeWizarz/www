story: Shannon is a native Californian and loves to connect and engage people through
  stories. When she’s not hanging out with her cat Gatsby, you can find her reading
  a book (preferably on the beach!), listening to a podcast, exploring new places
  with friends, watching a hockey game (go Kings go!), taking a new workout class
  or perfecting her baking/cooking skills. Most recently, she’s tried her hand at
  pickleball.
