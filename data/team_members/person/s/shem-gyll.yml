remote_story: 'Everything about remote work is more streamlined, modern and accessible
  than traditional work. Even applying for remote roles these days is far easier and
  more productive! Working remotely allows me to focus more on my work without outside
  distractions in a zen-like trance where productivity just flows simply and easily.
  I like to walk a lot so working remote gives me opportunities to walk during my
  breaks or before work, sometimes even taking a long walk to somewhere peaceful before
  clocking in for the day.
