story: 'I''ve lived most of my life in stadiums.  I played quarterback for Arizona
  State University. After my playing days I pursued my passion for songwriting. What
  started as a way of open-source journaling, organically grew into millions of listeners.
  I went on four tours around the US, and devised a way for my songs to paint with
  their own vibration through a subwoofer. I hosted live installations, performing
  as the songs drew flower-like patterns. The visual representation of sound is fascinating
  to me and a reminder of our interconnectivity. My love of DevOps began with GitLab.
  I am inspired to contribute to a team that lives transparency, is the future of
  DevSecOps and the future of work.
