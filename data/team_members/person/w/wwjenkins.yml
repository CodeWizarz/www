story: Wade's favorite projects involve blending music and technology.  Sometimes
  that's turning data anaylsis techniques into a percussion quartet, other times it's
  been bringing an ensemble mentality to research support. Wade lives in East Tennessee
  with his wife and kids.  He and his family are always trying to figure out how to
  spend more times in the mountains and if it's really time to re-watch The West Wing
  again.
