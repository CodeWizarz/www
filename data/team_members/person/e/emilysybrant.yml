story: As a designer, Emily is a passionate advocate for design systems, accessibility,
  and a collaborative approach to design. In her free time, she's an avid traveler
  and caretaker of 2 cats and 100+ houseplants. She's logged over 500 unique craft
  beers on Untappd, and she once got attacked by an ostrich. She's weirdly passionate
  about the differences between em dashes, en dashes, and hyphens&mdash;ask her about
  it!
