story: Born and raised in Istanbul, Eren has worked in numerous architectural and
  team-lead roles in DevOps and Data Engineering, since he moved to Hamburg in 2013.
  His enjoyment of using GitLab for CI/CD and GitOps across different companies and

  drums, composing music for his band, participating in local chess tournaments (despite
  often losing), or enjoying time with his partner.
