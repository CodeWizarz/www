story: "Emma has a deep sense of curiosity rooted in her scientific education in Physiology
  and Evolutionary Biology.\nAfter starting her career in horticultural research she
  shifted her path to the world of Business Analytics and hasn't looked back! \nShe
  loves all analytics topics, but Product Analytics hold a special place in her heart.\nWhen
  she is not poking around a dataset or deciding on which visualizations best communicate
  the right story, she is exploring the Northwestern mountains of Colorado, reading
  a sci-fi novel, or trying to learn how to cook something exotic and new.\n"
