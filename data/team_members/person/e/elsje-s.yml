remote_story: 'Even though I worked remotely for many years as a telemarketing consultant
  for my customers, I was always the "remote person" with others working from their
  office. I never truly felt part of the team. I also worked in a permanent role for
  a US-based company for four years with the EMEA team all working from home, but
  we were often out of the loop. At GitLab we are all on the same level; because we
  are all remote there is no ability to leave people out of the loop as eveything
  is written down which is a necessity in our async-working world, and it works seamlessly.
  GitLab is the best move I ever made.
