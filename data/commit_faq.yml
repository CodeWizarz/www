questions:
  - question: What is GitLab Groundworks
    answer: |
      <p>GitLab Groundworks are training and certification courses hosted during Commit. While Commit Virtual is free, these are paid training courses available as an add-on. During the course, you’ll spend six hours with GitLab experts from our Professional Services team, who will guide you through in-depth product demonstrations and hands-on activities. After the course, you’ll have two weeks to test your knowledge and get certified.</p>
  - question: What’s included in the course(s)?
    answer: |
      <ul>
      <li>6+ hours of on demand video and other content, available during and for 3 months after Commit.</li>
      <li>Access to our demo environment where you will be able to access all GitLab features to practice the capabilities reviewed during the instructor's presentation/demo. The hands-on certification assessment is also conducted in the same demo environment.</li>
      <li>Option to get certified within two weeks following Commit</li>
      </ul>
  - question: Who should participate?
    answer: |
      <p>Anyone is welcome to take either of the GitLab Groundworks courses, though we recommend “GitLab with Git Basics” for anyone new to Git and GitLab and “GitLab CI/CD” for technical project leads.</p>
      <p>While anyone can take the courses, GitLab Groundworks is not the same as a partner certification which will be launched in the future and will not be covered by GitLab.</p>
  - question: How do I get certified?
    answer: |
      <p>Following Commit, you will be emailed access to the certification which you must complete within two weeks. The certification consists of two parts, a written/multiple choice test and a hands-on certification assessment which is conducted in the same demo environment as the course. Our team will grade your assessment and send you a pass/fail.</p>
  - question: What if I don’t pass the certification?
    answer: |
      <p>The training should provide everything needed to be able to pass the assessments. Should you not pass the first time, the assessments can be taken again until passed. There is no need to pay an additional fee if a passing score is not obtained the first time.</p>
  - question: Can I take both courses?
    answer: |
      <p>Due to the length of the course, we advise that you only take one course during GitLab Commit.</p>
