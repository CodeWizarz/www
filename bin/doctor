# This support script attempts to determine if the user's local installation of the handbook is setup correctly.
# Specifically, it attempts to validate that the user has the minimum set of requirements to run other important scripts such as
# `bin/release-post-assemble`. THe intention here is to help non-engineering team members self-service updating their systems
# as they carry out duties like release post assembly on an infrequent basis where the handbook dependencies may have
# unknowingly shifted.
#
# usage `./bin/doctor`
# caveat: requires some ruby version already installed
