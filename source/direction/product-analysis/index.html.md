## Product Data Insights overview
{:.no_toc}

The Product Data Insights team (formerly known as "Product Analysis") was created in October 
2020 to provide dedicated, specialized analytics resources for the GitLab Product division 
and to support product data-related analysis. The team consists of product analysts, and reports 
to the Senior Director, Product Monetization & Operations. The team's primary customers are 
Product Managers across all sections, stages, and groups. 

In addition to working with the Product organization, Product Data Insights is part of the 
[Research & Development (R&D) Data Fusion Team](/handbook/business-technology/data-team/#analytics-engineering-team), 
enabling collaboration between the product analysts and analytics engineers on the central 
[Data team](/handbook/business-technology/data-team/). Product Data Insights is also a member 
of the [Functional Analytics Center of Excellence (FACE)](/handbook/business-technology/data-team/functional-analytics-center-of-excellence/), 
a group of functional analytics teams across GitLab.

## Vision

Simply put, the Product Data Insights team is charged with supporting product-related data needs 
across GitLab. While the scope is quite broad, the team is organized to maximize support of the 
Product division, while protecting time for cross-functional initiatives. The Product Data Insights 
team delivers actionable insights that help the Product division make responsible, data-driven 
decisions in feature development, prioritization, and improving the user experience. Part of 
Product Data Insights' role is also to enable greater self-service of product-related data and 
follow GitLab's [handbook-first approach](/company/culture/all-remote/handbook-first-documentation/) 
to build a strong remote culture.

## Working with Us

You can read about the Product Data Insights team's issue intake, prioritization, and team 
processes on their [handbook page](/handbook/product/product-analysis/).

### Product division support

To maximize the team's ability to support a large product organization, Product Data Insights 
is structured so that a single analyst supports a [section (or sections)](/handbook/product/categories/#devops-stages). 
This gives analysts the opportunity to build subject matter expertise in an area of the product 
and the data associated with it. In addition, it provides both analysts and PMs with a consistent 
counterpart for their data-related needs. The analyst is intended to be an embedded member of 
the Product team to encourage closer collaboration and increase the impact of analysis on the 
product.

### Data program collaboration

As a functional analytics team, Product Data Insights is reliant on other teams within the Data 
Program to provide high-quality, easily-accessible data. As such, the team collaborates 
closely with the central [Data team](/handbook/business-technology/data-team/) and 
[Analytics Instrumentation group](/handbook/product/analytics-instrumentation-guide/). 
Here is a quick summary of the responsibilities of each of these 3 teams: 

| Team Name | DRI | Goal | Example Tasks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Product Data Insights | Carolyn Braza: Senior Manager, Product Data Insights | Perform analysis to unlock product insights and champion data-driven product decisions | Perform ad hoc product analysis; create and maintain standardized Product metric dashboards; consult on data collection, instrumentation, and modeling |
| Analytics Instrumentation | Sam Kerr: Group Manager, Product Analytics | Define and improve capabilities of product data set | Build reliable and scalable tooling for product data instrumentation and collection; ensure our product data collection adheres to our [commitment to user privacy](/handbook/product/analytics-instrumentation-guide/service-usage-data-commitment/); empower team members to create new instrumentation, charts, and dashboards in a self-service fashion |
| Data Team | Israel Weeks: Senior Manager, Data | Build and maintain product data models and infrastructure to support data analysis | Create repeatable and reliable product data sets, models, related data pipelines/processes; adhere to Trusted Data standards |

#### High level collaboration workflow between the three teams

1. A data question needs to be answered with product data, the requester [opens a Product Data Insights 
issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/product-analytics/-/issues/new?issuable_template=Ad%20Hoc%20Request)
1. Product analyst triages issue and determines if the required data is available and accessible
   1. If the required data is not currently collected (or there is an issue with the collection), 
   work with Analytics Instrumentation and/or Product teams to start collecting it
   1. If the required data is collected but not exposed (ex: it is in the PREP database), work 
   with the central Data team to surface and/or model the data
1. Product analyst performs the analysis, creates a dashboard, etc
1. Product analyst determines if the analysis needs to be repeatable or there is an opportunity 
to improve data modeling
   1. If applicable, work with the central Data team to create a trusted data model to enable 
   future analysis
