The market is divided between big tech entrants building on top of complete Marketing Automation platforms marketed towards enterprise marketing orgs and stand-alone tools user engagement tools that are marketed towards Product (and occasionally Development) teams.

* **Enterprise Marketing Automation** - Some examples of these are Adobe’s [RT CDP](https://business.adobe.com/products/real-time-customer-data-platform/RTCDP.html), Oracle’s [Unity](https://www.oracle.com/cx/customer-data-platform/), Twilio’s [Segment](https://segment.com/), [mParticle](https://www.mparticle.com/solutions/real-time-personalization-targeting/) and Microsoft's [Dynamic 365 CDP](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/customer-data-platform/). This class of products all focus on customer data collection for the purposes of marketing automation with limited direct customer engagement tools. The primary buyer for this class of tools is a CMO. Interestingly, **many of these tools focus their attention on developer-enabled data management** as that is a critical stepping stone to enabling Marketing and Product teams. 
* **User Engagement** - Another class of products is targeting smaller organizations and Product and Development teams directly. These include [Pendo](https://www.pendo.io/), [Amplitude](https://amplitude.com/), [PostHog](https://posthog.com/), [LogRocket](https://logrocket.com/), [GlassBox](https://www.glassbox.com/?utm_source=ppc&utm_medium=google&utm_campaign=brand&lsd=OA-PPC-Adwords&gclid=CjwKCAiA9aKQBhBREiwAyGP5lSLyGJZUQIIli9pacrvj18QYa4SXm2XPSZnI9twyNEjD-WulIgN1qBoC1a4QAvD_BwE) and Google’s [Firebase Engage](https://firebase.google.com/products-engage). The primary buyer of this class of tools is a CTO/CPO. Interestingly, **few of these products offer both a SaaS and Self-Managed option**.
* **Application Monitoring Solutions (APM)** - Finally, there is a class of applications focused on APM use cases. Some examples include [NewRelic](https://newrelic.com/), [DataDog](https://www.datadoghq.com/product/apm/), [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/), [HoneyComb](https://www.honeycomb.io/), and [Dynatrace](https://www.dynatrace.com/).

We are starting to see competitors from both the APM space and the user engagement space begin to expand into the other. This is a signal that they see the value in both observability and product analytics, which is validation for our direction to pursue both in GitLab.
