The Manage stage has several features that enable users to quickly get started with using GitLab. These features are available in Core and are Free. However, as we move into specific use-cases for Enterprise customers that need to manage their GitLab organization at scale, features will be introduced into paid tiers as well and are intended to drive [company-level financial goals](https://about.gitlab.com/company/okrs/).

Full list of features by tier under Manage stage are [here](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/features/#manage)
