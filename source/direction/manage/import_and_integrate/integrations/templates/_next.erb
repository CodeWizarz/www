From mid July 2023 we won't be able to continue focusing on Integrations, that includes Jira integrations that [we offer](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/jira/) as well as Slack integrations. For now we are putting Integrations Category in maintenance mode, as we shift our attention to improve high-priority importers, GitLab to GitLab importer, GitHub importer and BitBucket Server importer.
We are looking forward to come back to this work in 2024.
