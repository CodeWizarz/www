## The Import and Integrate group

**Content last reviewed on 2023-07-27**

This is the direction page for the [Import and Integrate group](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/#import-and-integrate-group) which is part of the [Manage stage](/direction/manage) of the DevOps lifecycle and is maintained by the group's Product Manager, [Magdalena Frankiewicz](https://gitlab.com/m_frankiewicz) ([E-mail](mailto:mfrankiewicz@gitlab.com)). 

Import and Integrate group is responsible for the following categories: 

|  Category   |   Direction  |  Description | Current focus
|  ---   |   ---   |   ---   |
| Importers | [Direction page](/direction/manage/import_and_integrate/importers/) | Migration of groups and projects from one GitLab instance to another, importing projects from other software development tools like GitHub or BitBucket. | 100% |
| Internationalization | [Direction page](/direction/manage/import_and_integrate/internationalization) | Translation of the GitLab application to many languages, localization to countries and regions. | 0% |
| Integrations | [Direction page](/direction/manage/import_and_integrate/integrations) | Intuitive collaboration with tools GitLab's customers rely on. | 0% |
| Webhooks | [Direction page](/direction/manage/import_and_integrate/webhooks) | Integration with custom applications that GitLab's customers rely on. | 0% |
| API | [Direction page](/direction/manage/import_and_integrate/api) | GitLab's APIs and related tooling. | 0% |

Given unlimited resources and time, we'd love to prioritize and support all possible integrations, but our strategy will provide the guiding rules and logic for how we want to focus our group's efforts. 

### What is Not Planned Right Now

Integrations (from mid July 2023), Webhooks and API categories (from May 2023) are currently in maintenance mode. Due to this, there will be no dedicated investment in those categories until the end of the year. We will re-visit this in 2024. We will support only the most critical and severe bug fixes with significant business impact while we shift our attention to improve high-priority importers, GitLab to GitLab importer, GitHub importer and BitBucket Server importer.
