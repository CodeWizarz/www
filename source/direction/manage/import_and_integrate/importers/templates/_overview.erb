A typical organization looking to adopt GitLab already has many other tools. Artifacts such as code, build pipelines, issues and epics may already exist and are being used daily. Seamless transition of work in progress is critically important and a great experience during this migration creates a positive first impression of GitLab. Solving these transitions, even for the complex cases, is crucial for GitLabâ€™s ability to expand in the market. Instilling the confidence in the user that their data will be migrated quickly and with maximum care is of utmost importance.

Supporting the [GitLab-hosted First](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/#gitlab-hosted-first) product theme, the Import and Integrate group is working towards making imports reliable and performant at any scale. Large-scale moves to GitLab should be significantly easier and ultimately reach the first-class level exeprience. 

Areas of interest and improvement can be organized by the following goals:

* **Ease of use**
Customers looking to import their data sometimes struggle to find the place in GitLab where they can initiate imports. Once found, the user interactions are not always intuitive and the flow is not fully user-friendly. Improving the user experience in this area will make our importers more lovable.

* **Reliability**
A portion of our current issues are related to the reliability of the solution. Imports don't always succeed and when they fail, there is little guidance for the user on steps they can take to remedy the failure. We are working on making our importers more reliable, so that our customers can have confidence in the migration process.

* **Scalability and performance**
Large organizations looking to move possibly hundreds or thousands of projects from GitHub to GitLab or from self-managed GitLab instance to GitLab.com need to be able to do so in a performant way.

At this time, GitLab is targeting the following high-level areas for import: GitLab self-managed to GitLab.com, planning tools, CI/CD tools, and source control tools.

The Import and Integration group is focused on migrating groups and projects from one GitLab instance to another, as well as on importers from other software development tools like GitHub or Bitbucket.
