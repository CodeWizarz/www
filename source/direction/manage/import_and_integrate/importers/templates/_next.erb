In 2023, we want to reach a production-quality, easy to use tool for migrating GitLab resources between instances of GitLab. It should gracefully recover from errors and import over nearly 100% of relevant objects.

Since version 14.3, GitLab has supported migrating GitLab groups by direct transfer, where, rather than manually uploading export files, data is transferred directly from the source instance to the target instance. In GitLab 15.8 we included the ability to migrate projects by direct transfer as a Beta. This beta feature is available to everyone, enabled by default on GitLab.com and with some configuration on self-managed GitLab instances. You can read more about the benefits of the method and how to use it in a [blog post](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2023/01/18/try-out-new-way-to-migrate-projects/) or directly check the tool's [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/import/index.html#migrate-groups-by-direct-transfer-recommended).

Work on migrating GitLab resources by direct transfer can be tracked in [gitlab&2771](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2771) and is layed out in more deatils in epics:
- [Ensure reliable migrations of large groups and projects](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9759).
- [Enable to retry chosen parts of migration, e.g single projects](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9760).
- [Provide actionable feedback in case of issues occuring](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9763).
- [Further improve tool's documentation](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9758).

If you have any **feedback** regarding the tool, please comment on [this feedback issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/284495).

*What about migrating projects using file exports?*

Once the migrating projects by direct transfer feature is ready for production use at any scale, migrating groups and projects using file exports will be disabled by a feature flag and only migrating groups and projects by direct transfer will be available in the UI and API.

Because migrating by direct transfer requires network connection between instances or GitLab.com, customers that are using air-gapped networks with no network connectivity between their GitLab instances will need to reenable migrating using file exports. They will be able to use migrating groups and projects by direct transfer after we extend this solution to also support offline instances.

We will not fully remove migrating using file exports until we support all our customers with a new solution.

In second half of 2023 we also continue the work on GitHub importer ([documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/import/github.html)) to:

- [Improve the reliability of large projects imports from GitHub to GitLab](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5042).
- [Improve integrity of data imported from GitHub by solving related bugs](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3050).
