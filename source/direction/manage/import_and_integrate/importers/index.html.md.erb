### Introduction and how you can help

Thanks for visiting this category direction page on Importers in GitLab. This page belongs to the [Import and Integrate](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/#import-and-integrate-group) group of the Manage stage and is maintained by the group's Product Manager, [Magdalena Frankiewicz](https://gitlab.com/m_frankiewicz) ([E-mail](mailto:mfrankiewicz@gitlab.com), [Calendly](https://calendly.com/gitlab-magdalenafrankiewicz/45mins)).

This direction page is a work in progress, and everyone can contribute:
 
- Please comment and contribute in the linked [issues](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/issues/?sort=created_date&state=opened&label_name%5B%5D=Category%3AImporters&first_page_size=100) and [epics](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics?state=opened&page=1&sort=start_date_desc&label_name[]=Category:Importers) on this page. Sharing your feedback directly on GitLab.com is the best way to contribute to our strategy and vision.
 - Please share feedback directly via email, Twitter, or on a video call. If you're a GitLab user and want to discuss how GitLab can improve Importers, we'd especially love to hear from you.

### Strategy and Themes

<!-- Describe your category. Capture the main problems to be solved in market (themes). Describe how you intend to solve these with GitLab (strategy). Provide enough context that someone unfamiliar with the details of the category can understand what is being discussed. -->

### 1 year plan
<!--
1 year plan for what we will be working on linked to up-to-date epics. This section will be most similar to a "road-map". Items in this section should be linked to issues or epics that are up to date. Indicate relative priority of initiatives in this section so that the audience understands the sequence in which you intend to work on them. 
 -->

<%= partial("direction/manage/import_and_integrate/importers/templates/next") %>

#### What is next for us
<!-- This is a 3 month look ahead for the next iteration that you have planned for the category. This section must provide links to issues or
or to [epics](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-processes/#epics-for-a-single-iteration) that are scoped to a single iteration. Please do not link to epics encompass a vision that is a longer horizon and don't lay out an iteration plan. -->
This is a look ahead for the next iteration (about 3 months) that we have planned for the category:

- [Reduce the failure rate of the GitLab group and project migration by direct transfer](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8927).
- [Update import status on group import history page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/383757).
- [Move GitLab direct transfer importer hardcoded validations to settings](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/384976), so that self-managed GitLab users can tune them according to their needs.
- [Preserve information on pull request reviewers in BitBucket Server importer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/416611).
- [Improve the reliability of large projects imports from GitHub to GitLab](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5042).
- [Improve integrity of data imported from GitHub by solving related bugs](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3050).
- [Improve integrity of data migrated between GitLab instances by solving related bugs](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6629).

#### What we are currently working on
<!-- Scoped to the current month. This section can contain the items that you choose to highlight on the kickoff call. Only link to issues, not Epics.  -->
These are highlights from the current month's planned work:

- [Export and import in batches when migrating GitLab projects by direct transfer](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9036). 
This improvement is already available by default on GitLab.com. Users migrating from a self-managed GitLab instance to GitLab.com have to have their self-managed instance on at least GitLab 16.2 version, where batched export is available, to benefit from this improvement.
Users migrating from GitLab.com to a self-managed GitLab instance have to have their self-managed instance on at least GitLab 16.2 version and enable the `bulk_imports_batched_import_export` [feature flag](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/feature_flags.html) to benefit from this improvement.
In 16.3 we plan to remove the feature flag.
- [Update import status on group import history page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/383757).
- [Move GitLab direct transfer importer hardcoded validations to settings](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/384976), so that self-managed GitLab users can tune them according to their needs.
- [Preserve information on pull request reviewers in BitBucket Server importer](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/416611).

#### What we recently completed
<!-- Lookback limited to 3 months. Link to the relevant issues or release post items. -->

- [Allowed GitHub importer to use a pool of access tokens](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/337232) to speed up the import from GitHub. Available via API only. *16.2*
- Fixed the bug when [merge request comments in a project migrated from GitHub cannot be resolved](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/381503). *16.2*
- [Updated BitBucket Server to import projects using multiple workers](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/411534). This improves reliability of the BitBucket Server importer when importing large projects and reduces the timeouts rate. *16.1*
- [Provided informative feedback upon finished import from GitHub](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/386748). *16.1*
- [Filtered GitHub repos available for import and organise results in tabs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/385113). We made search of GitHub repos to be imported easier by showing them in three tabs: Owned, Collaborated and Organization. You can further narrow down the search by organization, choosing it from the dropdown. *16.0*
- Enabled [importing GitHub repository collaborators as GitLab project members](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/388716) on demand, by [placing it in the list of additional items to be imported](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/398154). We added an option to import GitHub repository direct collaboratios (that can be mapped to GitLab users) as GitLab project members. *15.10, 16.0*

#### What is Not Planned Right Now
<!--  Often it's just as important to talk about what you're not doing as it is to
discuss what you are. This section should include items that people might hope or think
we are working on as part of the category, but aren't, and it should help them understand why that's the case.
Also, thinking through these items can often help you catch something that you should
in fact do. We should limit this to a few items that are at a high enough level so
someone with not a lot of detailed information about the product can understand -->

Group Import continuously evaluates and updates the Importers' direction and roadmap. As part of that effort, new Importers such as Trello, CircleCI, Subversion and Azure DevOps (TFS) are being discussed. While these discussions may ultimately lead to the implementation of a new feature or a new Importer, none of them are being planned at this time.

Given our focus on migrating GitLab groups and project by direct transfer and improving reliability and data integrity of GitHub importer, we are not prioritizing any work that is not in scope of these two efforts. This includes all other importers, as well as issues for GitHub Importer which are not related to our focus area (e.g. importing additional relations).

Group Import is not focused on the ability to regularly back up and restore your GitLab data, for example nightly backups of all your data. For more information on this use-case, please see the [Backup and Restore category direction page](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/geo/backup_restore/).

### Best in Class Landscape
<!-- Blanket description consistent across all pages that clarifies what GitLab means when we say "best in class" -->

BIC (Best In Class) is an indicator of forecated near-term market performance based on a combination of factors, including analyst views, market news, and feedback from the sales and product teams. It is critical that we understand where GitLab appears in the BIC landscape.

#### Key Capabilities 
<!-- For this product area, these are the capabilities a best-in-class solution should provide -->

This table provides a quick overview of what GitLab importers exist today and which most important objects they each support. This list is not exhaustive and the detailed information can be found on the [Importers documentation page](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/import/).

#### Roadmap
<!-- Key deliverables we're focusing on to build a BIC solution. List the epics by title and link to the epic in GitLab. Minimize additional description here so that the epics can remain the SSOT. -->

In the 2023 we aim to first of all release migrating projects by direct transfer to general availability (currently it is in Beta) by working to:
- [Further improve tool's documentation](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9758).
- [Ensure reliable migrations of large groups and projects](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9759).
- [Enable to retry chosen parts of migration, e.g single projects](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9760).
- [Provide actionable feedback in case of issues occuring](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9763).
- [Show comprehensive migration results](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9757).

In pararel we continue the work to obtain the [feature parity and complete maturity of GitHub importer](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2984) as well as to improve [the reliability of large projects imports](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5042) and [the integrity of data imported](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3050).

After reaching general availbility of GitLab migration by direct transfer, in 2024, we will work on [migrating users](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4616) and importing more of [relevant GitLab resources](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9319).

### Automating group and project import with Professional Services

While the long-term goal for the Import group is to provide all the GitLab importing capabilities needed by our customers in our application, we recognize that GitLab's current capabilities may not support specific migration scenarios. Often, we're not aware of these requirements until a large customer provides us with specific migration requirements.

GitLab [Professional Services](https://about.gitlab.com/services/) team uses [Congregate](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/professional-services-automation/tools/migration/congregate) tool to orchestrate user, group, and project import API calls in order to help customers automate scaled migrations. With the feature of migrating groups and projects by direct transfer ready for production use at any scale, we will be able to substitute the part of Congregate handling migration on groups and projects.
