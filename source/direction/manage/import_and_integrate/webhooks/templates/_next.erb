Please be aware that Webhooks is Viable maturity and we are putting this category in maintenance mode from FY24Q2 (May 2023). Due to this, there will be no dedicated investment in this category maturity until further notice. We will support only the most critical and severe bug fixes with significant business impact while we shift our attention to improve high-priority importers, GitLab to GitLab importer, GitHub importer and BitBucket Server importer.

When we resume regular work on this category, we plan to focus on:

* [Generating audit events for webhooks and integrations](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8710)
* [Adding webhook metadata](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/353562)
* [Disableing invalid webhooks](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8198)

See our [planning epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2318).
