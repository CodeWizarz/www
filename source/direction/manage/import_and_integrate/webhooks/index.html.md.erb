### Introduction and how you can help

Thanks for visiting this category direction page on Webhooks in GitLab. This page belongs to the [Import and Integrate](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/categories/#import-and-integrate-group) group of the Manage stage and is maintained by the group's Product Manager, [Magdalena Frankiewicz](https://gitlab.com/m_frankiewicz) ([E-mail](mailto:mfrankiewicz@gitlab.com), [Calendly](https://calendly.com/gitlab-magdalenafrankiewicz/45mins)).

This direction page is a work in progress, and everyone can contribute:
 
- Please comment and contribute in the linked [issues](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/issues/?sort=created_date&state=opened&label_name%5B%5D=Category%3AWebhooks&first_page_size=20) and [epics](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics?state=opened&page=1&sort=start_date_desc&label_name[]=Category:Webhooks) on this page. Sharing your feedback directly on GitLab.com is the best way to contribute to our strategy and vision.
 - Please share feedback directly via email, Twitter, or on a video call. If you're a GitLab user and want to discuss how GitLab can improve Importers, we'd especially love to hear from you.

Items in this section should be linked to issues or epics that are up to date. Indicate relative priority of initiatives in this section so that the audience understands the sequence in which you intend to work on them.
