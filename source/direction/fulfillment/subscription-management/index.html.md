## Mission

Provide customers with an easy, informed and reliable experience to view and manage their subscriptions, billing details, and contacts.

## Overview

Once customer purchases a GitLab subscription - whether they worked with a sales rep or purchased directly from our website with a credit card - they should be able to view that subscription, modify it, and manage all of their billing information in one place (**[Customers Portal](https://customers.gitlab.com/)**). Customers that purchase via an authorized GitLab Channel Partner should be able to view and provision access to the purchased subscriptions, but will need to contact their reseller to make subscription changes.

Some subscription changes are automated: Quarterly Subscription Reconciliation (QSR) automatically bills for overages; and Auto-Renewal automatically renews eligible subscriptions. Both are geared towards creating a hands-off subscription management experience for our customers and internal teams.

## Roadmap and Planning

### What we recently completed

1. Improved transparency into the overages and related billing for SaaS customers ([at the time of adding users](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7230)).
1. Enabled [subscription auto-renewal](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/fulfillment-guide/#subscription-renewal-and-auto-renewal) for all major use cases.
1. [Completed research](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ux-research/-/issues/1782) on the Renewal experience and existing processes (both internal teams and GitLab customers) to understand and improve the Renewal process for all.
1. [New subscription display in Customers Portal for ramp subscriptions](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8748).
1. Renewal discounting functionality in preparation for the [GitLab Premium Price update](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2023/03/02/gitlab-premium-update/).

### What we're currently working on

1. **[Allowing customers that puchased via Reseller to access Customers Portal](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8941).** Reseller customers are unable to self-serve their access to what they purchased, having to contact Support for help.
1. **[Allowing Customers to invite multiple Billing Account Managers for the BillingAccount](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8951).** New navigation for Customers Portal, and ability to have multiple contacts that have permissions to manage subsccriptions and payment information for the Billing Account.

### What's next and why

1. **[Updating subscription display in Customers Portal to be more user friendly and aligned to Zuora data structure](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9746).** Our current subscription display is not consistent with how data is structured in Zuora. Due to this, it has been increasingly difficult to adapt it to the new Order to Cash features and use cases that we've been developing.
1. **[Moving subscription Renewal emails out of Zuora and into CustomersDot](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9303).** Renewal emails sent from Zuora are very generic and cause confusion for the customers. We will be making renewal emails more relevant, clear and actionable.

### 1 Year Plan

Fulfillment section is focused on [6 main investment themes](../index.html.md#1-year-plan). Out of those themes, we have :
-->
### What we're not working on

1. **We will not be moving subscription management to gitlab.com**. There are no plans to move SM subscription purchase to gitlab.com; therefore, we will keep the experience for both SaaS and SM in Customers Portal, so that it is consistent for all customers. Many of our customers purchase both SaaS and SM subscriptions. Fulfillment's investment in [using GitLab.com single sign-on as the login method for Customers Portal](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8905) opens up the possibility for more streamlined purchase experiences across SaaS and SM without relying on building experiences within the GitLab product.
