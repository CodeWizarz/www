## Mission

> Within the category of the CustomersDot Application the goal is to improve the underlying data architecture and OTC orchestration of the application for anyone who wants to contribute. Contributors will be able to deliver enhancements to the CustomersDot application with confidence, speed and efficiency.

## Overview

 Within [CustomersDot](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/) our customers and all relevant stakeholders are able to manage subscriptions, customers, billing accounts and licensens.

 [CustomersDot](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/customers-gitlab-com/) is the central application to contribute for the Fulfillment Platform group.

The Fulfillment Platform group is responsible for the following areas of CustomersDot:

- Zuora integration
- Sign-up/Sign in/SSO
- CustomersDot admin view and functionality
- OTC data architecture and orchestration within CustomersDot

The Fulfillment Platform group owns, maintains and evolves the underlying architecture and orchestration for GitlLabâ€™s order-to-cash flow (OTC). 

## Target audience

The target audience of the CustomersDot application spans all stakeholder groups, as it enables them to manage subscriptions payments, customers, billing accounts, and licenses.

Therefore, we see the following parties interacting with the CustomersDot application:
    
- Customers (SaaS, self-managed, dedicated)
- Other fulfilment groups and team members
- Internal stakeholders (Customer Success, Sales, Billing)

We are improving the experience of all our customers (self-service, sales-assisted and reseller customers) by improving the flow of systems and the accuracy of subscription data.

## What's up now ( up to 12 months)

Within the next 12 months we want to strengthen the foundation of the fulfillment platform. Our main focus is to improve our order-to-cash systems and underlying data architecture, which will help us scale as GitLab continues to grow.

The focus will help us to support the scale within Fulfillment and adjacent areas as GitLab continues to grow.
