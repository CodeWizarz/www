Secure is focused on providing enterprise-grade application security testing (AST) capabilities to minimize overall risk.  The intent is to provide enough value in paid features so as to allow Secure to contribute in a significant way over the next 3 years toward GitLab&apos;s [company-level financial goals](https://about.gitlab.com/company/okrs/).

Although paid features are the primary focus, there are several reasons why features for unpaid tiers might be prioritized above paid features:
1. The Secure stage has a powerful potential to help improve the security of projects everywhere.  Features with the potential to significantly improve the security posture of all projects will be highly prioritized and made available in an unpaid tier.
1. To continue to be [good stewards in the open source community](https://about.gitlab.com/company/stewardship/), any basic integration with open source projects will be available in an unpaid tier by default, along with the "table stakes" set of functionality required to allow that feature to be usable with GitLab.  Any open source project integrations that currently exist in paid tiers will have a discussion opened about moving the integration to an unpaid tier.

##### Core/Free
This tier is the primary way to increase broad adoption of the Secure stage, as well as encouraging community contributions and improving security across the entire GitLab user base.

As a general rule of thumb, features will fall in the Core/Free tier when they meet one or more of the following criteria:
* The feature is primarily for an individual with a few small projects rather than meeting the needs of an organization or enterprise that is operating at scale
* The feature is provided by an integration with an open source project rather than being natively developed by GitLab
* The feature has the potential to increase the security posture of all GitLab projects in a significant way, or there is a reasonable ethical/moral obligation to make the feature available to all users
* The ongoing cost for GitLab to maintain and update the feature is relatively minimal

Some examples include:
* Basic installation and use of scanners, especially when the underlying scanner is taken from an open source project
* The basic ability to retrieve scan results in some way
* Documentation and directions on how to install and configure a scanner

##### Premium/Silver
This tier is not a significant part of Secure&apos;s pricing strategy.

##### Ultimate/Gold
This tier is the primary focus for the Secure stage as the security posture of an organization is typically a primary concern of the executive team and even the board of directors.  Just as a major security incident has far reaching consequences that impact the entirety of an organization, the features and capabilities that enable organizations to assess their overall security risk tend to be valued with equal weight.  The types of capabilities that fall in the Ultimate/Gold tier vs an unpaid tier should be those that are necessary for an organization, rather than an individual, to properly secure their code before pushing it into a production environment.

As a general rule of thumb, features will fall in the Ultimate/Gold tier when they meet one or more of the following criteria:
* The feature is focused on enabling an organization or enterprise to operate at scale rather than an individual with a few smaller personal projects
* The feature is natively developed or [acquired](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/acquisitions/) by GitLab rather than being provided by an open source project
* The feature has a significant ongoing cost for GitLab to maintain and update the feature

Some examples include:
* Vulnerability management functionality, including [Security Dashboards](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/security_dashboard/) to aggregate, prioritize, and remediate findings as well as [vulnerability workflows](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/vulnerabilities/), including inline workflows, such as merge request and pipeline security reports, that help streamline and expedite the vulnerability remediation process
* Scanning capabilities that are not open source and provide value above what typical open source tools provide
* Enterprise features including summary reports, UI tools to simplify and streamline scanner configurations, and creation or enforcement of scanning policies
* Vulnerability research including a dedicated vulnerability database enabling better security scanner true positive detection rates
