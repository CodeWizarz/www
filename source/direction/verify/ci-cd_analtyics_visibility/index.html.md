## Competitive Landscape


The competitive landscape is generally split into two categories, offering insights and test prediction.

In the insights space DataDog has a [CI and Test Visibility](https://docs.datadoghq.com/continuous_integration/) offering and [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/docs/insights/) has had an insights offering for some time. While there is no main GitHub actions functionality there are several offerings in the marketplace for collecting test/run data and displaying it on a dashboard.

In the Test Reduction area Sealights offers a [CutTests](https://www.sealights.io/solutions/cut-end-to-end-tests-cycle-time/) solution and [Redefine.dev](https://www.redefine.dev/product) is a new player in the space taking advantage of AI to reduce future test runs for faster pipelines.

## Top Vision Item(s)

Looking to the future, we have plans to help you better monitor and understand your pipeline [epic#4794](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4794). Having details about pipeline activities (such as job duration) will allow you to see and react to what's happening while your pipeline is running. Beyond using data simply for reactive purposes, we have plans for a customizable UI for historical pipeline analytics so you can see the trends that will guide your planning and decision-making. 

Even further into the future, we are looking to expand insights and predications of CI use to help you reduce waste in our 3-year vision via [gitlab&4793](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4793).
