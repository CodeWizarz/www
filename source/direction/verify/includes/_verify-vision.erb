### Continuous Integration Vision

From this [mission](/direction/verify/#continuous-integration-mission), the GitLab Continuous Integration three-year vision is to become the leading platform for [Software Engineers](/handbook/product/personas/#sasha-software-developer), [DevOps Engineers](/handbook/product/personas/#devon-devops-engineer), and [Development Team leads](/handbook/product/personas/#delaney-development-team-lead) for automatically building, testing, as well as optimizing code. 

We will execute against this vision by:
1. Delivering on the [Ops as code](/direction/ops/#ops-as-code) promise via the [pipelines as code](/direction/ops/#pipelines-as-code) experience, improving how Software Developers alongside DevOps Engineers author pipelines and configure their `.gitlab-ci.yml` files.
1. Empowering [Ops for all](/direction/ops/#operations-for-all) by building in visibility to changes made to code before production, compute minutes consumption, as well as natively compliant, secure supply chain workflows to support the building, testing, and optimizing of code from a single CI tool.
1. Leverage the data available in the end-to-end GitLab DevOps platform to inform optimizations that will drive fast and reliable pipelines.
1. Growing GitLab.com users by investing in [GitLab-hosted first](/direction/#product-strategy) and scaling our capabilities to meet Enterprise-level needs.
