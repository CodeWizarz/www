- Mature [Value Streams Dashboard for Executives](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9317) to enable decision-makers to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for digital transformation improvements.In the first phases, we will focus on the following: 
   - [Executive-level summary](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9558) of key metrics related to software performance and flow of value across the organization. These views will visualize the highest level of data about health of the software organization, and the [DORA Performers](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/10416) score top to bottom.
   - [Visualizing metrics comparisons](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9559) to help decision-makers understand how different metrics are performing relative to each other or to identify trends and patterns in the data. In the next 1-3 releases we will add: [Vulnerabilities metrics](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/383697), [MR throughput](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/383665), [Pipelines metrics](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/388416) and ["Velocity" metric (total issues completed)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/386715).
   - [Filtering and drill-down](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/383684) into the underline data to get a deeper understanding of specific metrics or trends to identify actionable insights. We are adding [metrics](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/409394) and [labels filter](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/388890) to the new dashboard configuration file 
   - [Customizable widgets](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8925) to show data that is relevant to user's goals and needs.
- Value Streams Dashboard - [Adding "DORA Performers score" panel](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/10416) to visualize the status of the organization's DevOps performance levels across different projects.
- Value Streams Dashboard - [Adding Scheduled Reports / Reports Generation](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/10880) to allow decision-makers to focus on analyzing insights rather than spending time looking for the right dashboard with the relevant data.
- Value Streams Dashboard - adding the ["Product Analytics section" customizable UI capabilities](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8925). Integrate the Value streams dashboard page into the [product analytics schema driven UI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/analytics/analytics_dashboards.html).
- Value Streams Dashboard - Add ["Total Pipelines" metrics - monthly number of total pipelines](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/388416), to the comparison panel, to compare the performance of different pipeline configurations and identify which changes lead to better outcomes.
- Value Streams Dashboard -adding ["Usage overview" panel](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/386842), to help the executive understand how the team is utilizing the platform.
- Value Streams Dashboard - Adding [AI forecasting](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/407798/designs/sparklines_with_forecast_.png) to [optimize planning](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/plan/#use-devsecops-data-to-optimize-planning) in real-time. Forecasting will help software leaders and PMO plan for the future by predicting upcoming trends and identifying potential opportunities and challenges. This can help organizations be more proactive in their decision-making and planning processes. 
- Value Stream Dashboard - adding [Quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) and year-over-year YoY comparison view](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/387625) to visualize more than 6 months of analytics data.
- Enable fast analytical queries and deep data analysis by replicate the metrics data into [ClickHouse](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/10484).
- VSA Usability improvements - [adding predefined date range](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/408656), to simplify the date selection process and make it more efficient, accurate, and user-friendly.
- Improving Issues Analytics to optimize the VSM lifecycle - [Add total issues completed ("issues In/Out - Open vs Closed")](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/233905). 
- [Enhanced VSA stage time investigation](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8374) to help users quickly understand what has happened in the specific stage by visualizing the performance of the stage with the context of the work item (issues or MRs).
- Adding [VSA settings](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9129) with label filters configuration. In a similar way to boards, teams want to use saved filtered labels with value streams.
