## Stage Overview

The Plan Stage provides tools for teams to manage and optimize their work, track operational health and measure outcomes. As an end-to-end DevSecOps platform, GitLab is uniquely positioned to deliver a planning suite that enables business leaders to drive their vision and DevSecOps teams to deliver value while improving how they work. In addition, the unification of the DevSecOps process allows GitLab to interlink data across every stage of development, from ideation, to planning, implementation, deployment, and deliver value to customers.

## 3 Year Strategy

In three years, the Plan Stage market will:
* Continue to shift from project to product and focus on outcomes instead of output.
* Continue to move away from command and control mentality and instead empower teams to determine how they can contribute toward business objectives.
* Make operational efficiency and continual improvement a top priority.  
* Embrace AI within the Plan stage of the DevSecOps toolchain and lifecycle.
* Shift toward consolidation into a single platform for all stages of the DevSecOps lifecycle.

As a result, in three years, Gitlab will:
* Provide support for individual DevSecOps teams and entire organizations using scaled Agile frameworks.
* Allow GitLab to capture and tie metrics to [Work Items](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/work_items.html) to reflect business outcomes. 
* Surface metrics like DORA and Value Stream in key parts of a teams workflow to help drive improvements. 
* Support frameworks like OKRs that encourage bottom-up contributions. 
* Use downstream DevSecOps data for automation and machine learning to help teams improve their plans.
* Make it easy for non-Developer Personas to contribute to, read, and edit data in GitLab.

### What We Recently Completed

<%= partial("direction/plan/project_management/team_planning/recent_accomplishments") %>
* [Rich-text content editor](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7098)(**16.2**) - We often hear feedback from non-developers that editing text in markdown is not their prefered experience. The new rich-text content editor imakes it easier for everyone to contribute by providing a real-time preview and live rich editing of Markdown content. 
* [Value Stream Dashboard Configuration](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/388890)(**16.2**) - With a configuration file for the new Value Stream Dashboard you can define various settings and parameters, such as title, description, and number of panels and label filters. You can adjust the metrics comparison panel based on your areas of interest, filter out irrelevant information, and focus on the data that is most relevant to your analysis or decision-making process.
* [Value Stream Dashboard velocity metrics](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/383665)(**16.3**) - The Value Streams Dashboard has been enhanced with new metrics: Merge request (MR) throughput and Total closed issues (Velocity). With these metrics, you can identify low or high productivity months and the efficiency of merge request and code review processes. You can then gauge whether the Value Stream delivery is accelerating or not.
* [Interactive diff suggestions in merge requests](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/406726)(**16.2**)- When you suggest changes in a merge request, you can now edit your suggestions more quickly. In a comment, switch to the rich text editor and use the UI to move up and down the lines of text. With this change, you can view your suggestions exactly as they will appear when the comment is posted.
* Quick actions for work items (**16.5**)- - We continue to build out the work items framework, and have added quick actions to add [child](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/420797) and a [parent](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/420798) for a work item. These are convenience features that set the foudnation for the ability to set parent and child items in the UI.
* [Linked Items widget for work items](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/416558)(**16.5**) -  We continue to build out the work items framework, and you can now add related," "blocked by," or "blocking" to provide traceability between dependent and related work items. One advantage of the new work items experience over the existing implementation in issues/epics is that you are able to add these relationships across work item types.
* [Export individual wiki pages as PDF](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/414691)(**16.5**) - Now, sharing team knowledge is even more seamless. Exporting a wiki to PDF can be used for a variety of use cases. For example, to provide a copy of technical documentation that is kept in a wiki or share information in a wiki with project status. 
* [Resolve an issue thread](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/31114) (**16.5**) - Long-running issues with many threads can be challenging to read and track. You can now resolve a thread on an issue when the topic of discussion has concluded.

### What We Are Currently Working On

* Migrating [epics to the work items](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9290) framework will allow us to eventually bring more consistency with issues and address long-standing requests, like [assignees on epics](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4231).
<%= partial("direction/plan/project_management/team_planning/current_focus") %>
* Improving performance will continue to be a top priority in the near term. The rapid growth of GitLab.com has uncovered the need for continue focus on [database and query optimization](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5804).
* [Pages Multi-Version Support](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/10914) - Currently a project can have only a single version of a GitLab Pages site. This make it hard for customers to try new ideas on their sites without changing the only version of the site. Customers need a way to preview changes or have multiple environments for their GitLab Pages sites to make it possible to validate changes before deploying their site.
* [DORA Performance Panel](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/10416) - The Value Streams Dashboard can now be used to visualize the status of the organization's DevOps performance levels across different projects. This new view will enable the executive to track how the organization implements DevOps practices, and compare the DevOps DORA score performance against industry benchmarks.
* [ClickHouse readiness for General Availability](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9281) - In FY23 ClickHouse was selected as GitLab's standard datastore for features with big data and insert-heavy requirements (e.g. Observability, Analytics, etc.). ClickHouse is not intended to replace Postgres or Redis in GitLab's stack. We are currently working in the implementation of the first report, [contribution analytics](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/11732), with this new datastore.

### Cross-Stage Initiatives

Plan offers functionality that ties into workflows in other stages.  We are actively collaborating with other stages that are building upon Plan functionality to meet their users needs.

* The Manage:Import and Integrate group has built a Jira integration that displays Jira Issue data within GitLab. We will collaborate with that team to tie Jira Issues into more workflows like reporting and tying Jira Issues to higher level work items.
* The Manage:Import and Integrate owns the [Jira importer](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/import/jira.html) to allow Jira issues to be migrated to GitLab. We will continue to work with that team to extend GitLab work items to accomodate more critical data elements from Jira to ensure a seamless import process.
* The Plan and Tenant Scale groups are collaborating on the [Organizations](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/6473) initiative to simplify the management of work and team hierarchies in GitLab.
* The Plan stage and the [Service Desk Single Engineer Group](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/incubation/service-desk/) are collaborating on [accelerating Service Desk](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8769), which will extend work items to support adjacent use cases to portfolio and team planning.
* Plan:Product Planning is collaborating with the [OKR Single Engineer Group](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/incubation/okr/) to make OKRs generally available within GitLab.
* Plan:Optimize is collaborating with Manage:organization to Consolidate [Value Stream Analytics Group & Project into a single object - Workspace](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9295). 
* Plan:Optimize is collaborating with Analytics:Product Analytics to add [YML schema-driven customizable UI](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8925) to the Value Streams Dashboard. 
* Plan:Optimize is collaborating with Govern:Threat Insights to add [Vulnerabilities metrics to the Value Streams Dashboard](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/383697).
