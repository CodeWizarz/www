[Using DORA metrics](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/value-stream-management/dora/), Gitlab accelerates engineering work in the context of end-to-end value delivery.

DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment) metrics have become widely recognized and adopted as industry standards for measuring DevOps performance. Software leaders find DORA metrics very useful for measuring the outcome of DevOps because they provide valuable insights into the effectiveness and impact of their DevOps practices. DORA metrics are derived from extensive research conducted by the [DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA)](https://www.devops-research.com/research.html) team, which has identified a set of key metrics that correlate with high-performing software delivery and operational excellence.


The DORA team, has created a list of [four metrics that are straightforward, focused, and easy to implement](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/using-the-four-keys-to-measure-your-devops-performance). They form an excellent foundation for data-driven initiatives, helping improve existing DevSecOps efficiency while also building a bridge to business stakeholders.

These four "DORA" metrics are:

 - [Deployment Frequency](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/analytics/dora_metrics.html#deployment-frequency)
 - [Lead time for changes](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/analytics/dora_metrics.html#lead-time-for-changes)
 - [Time to restore service](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/analytics/dora_metrics.html#time-to-restore-service)
 - [Change Failure Rate](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/analytics/dora_metrics.html#change-failure-rate).


#### DORA and Value Stream Management:

DORA metrics are available in GitLab [Value Streams Dashboard](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/analytics/value_streams_dashboard.htm), [Insights reports](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/insights/#dora-query-parameters) and in the [CI/CD analytics reports](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/analytics/ci_cd_analytics.html#view-deployment-frequency-chart). [APIs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/dora/metrics.html) are also available for all four DORA metrics. In GitLab, DORA metrics are embedded as part of the [Value stream management end-to-end DevOps analytics framework](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/plan/value_stream_management/#value-stream-management-as-the-framework-for-end-to-end-devops-analytics). With DORA Metrics, Gitlab's VSM is visualized the work in the context of the value stream - measuring the velocity and stability of software delivery lifecycle through the [DORA4 metrics](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/analytics/#devops-research-and-assessment-dora-key-metrics). 

The following video provides a brief overview of Gitlab's DORA metrics:

The DORA metrics are not intended to be a one-size-fits-all solution but rather provide a set of key metrics that organizations can use as a starting point to assess their DevOps performance. While there may be variations and adaptations of these metrics based on specific organizational contexts, the core principles and concepts outlined by DORA have had a significant impact on the DevOps community and are widely regarded as industry standards for measuring DevOps success.

VersionOne, Experitest, Numerify, and XebiaLabs. Its plan to be a front-runner in AI-driven software delivery for Global 5000 enterprises.

[XebiaLabs' analytics (acquired by Digital.ai)](https://docs.xebialabs.com/xl-release/concept/release-dashboard-tiles.html) are predominantly focused on the Release Manager and give useful overviews of deployments, issue throughput and stages. The company integrates with JIRA, Jenkins, etc and end users can see in which stage of the release process they are.

#### Plutora
[Plutora Analytics](https://www.plutora.com/platform/plutora-analytics) Plutora is a privately held global software (SaaS) company, providing Value Stream Management solutions for enterprise IT in the areas of Release Management and Orchestration, Test Environment Management, Deployment Management, and Analytics.. Plutora seem to target mainly the release managers with their [Time to Value Dashboard](https://www.plutora.com/platform/time-to-value-dashboard). The company also integrates with JIRA, Jenkins, GitLab, CollabNet VersionOne, etc but there is still a lot of configuration that seems to be left to the user.

 **More competitors in our Landscape:**

#### CloudBees

### Analyst Landscape

In The Future of DevOps Toolchains Will Involve Maximizing Flow in IT Value Streams, Gartner recommended that "infrastructure and operations leaders responsible for selecting and deploying DevOps toolchains should: drive business ability by using DevOps value stream delivery platforms that reduce the overhead of managing complex toolchains." [1] By providing an entire DevOps platform as a single application, GitLab is uniquely suited to provide end-to-end visibility throughout the entire lifecycle without the “toolchain tax.” As the place where work happens, GitLab can also unite visualization with action, allowing users to jump from learning to doing at any time, without losing context.

[Gartner Market Guide for DevOps Value Stream Delivery Platforms](https://about.gitlab.com/analysts/gartner-vsdp21/)

Forrester's New Wave: Value Stream Management Tools, uncovered an emerging market. However, vendors from different niches of the development pipeline are converging to value stream management in response to customers seeking greater transparency into their processes.

Forrester’s vision for VSM includes:
- end-to-end visibility of the software development process, including the corresponding capture and storage of data, events, and artifacts
- definition and visualization of key performance indicators (KPIs)
- inclusive customer experience, which allows multiple roles (PMs, developers, QA, and release managers) to collaborate in one place
- governance, i.e. a framework to monitor compliance to organizational standards, automated audit capabilities, and traceability.

Other Analysts have highlighted that GitLab data gathering has much to offer and much more to mine and enable the insight generation. We have an immediate opportunity to extend the insight generation based on the data gathered in the delivery pipelines. Once this is achieved we will integrate additional data sources beyond the DevOps toolchains.

We have the ability to reach the decision makers that are consuming the insights generated from the GitLab platform, and one of the key elements here is getting beyond the DORA 4 metrics into those that are more specifically targeted: security, compliance, financial, product, but also enterprise architecture, AI/ML delivery teams and the like.
