- Add a new [Dashboard for Executive](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9317) to enable decision-makers to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities for digital transformation improvements. In the first phases, we will focus on the following: 
   - [Executive-level summary](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9558) of key metrics related to software performance and [DORA Performers score](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/10416) top to bottom.
   - Adding ["DORA Performers score"](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/386843) - organization level insights into DevOps performance across all projects. Buckets into the three DORA scores: High, Medium, Low (from the 2022 DORA report).
   - [Visualizing metrics comparisons](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9559) to help decision-makers understand how different metrics are performing relative to each other or to identify trends and patterns in the data.
   - [Filtering and drill-down](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/383684) into the underline data to get a deeper understanding of specific metrics or trends to identify actionable insights.  We are adding [metrics](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/409394) and [labels filter](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/388890) to the new dashboard configuration file.
   - [Customizable widgets](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8925) to show data that is relevant to user's goals and needs.
- Adding the Fifth DORA Metric - [Reliability - Operational performance](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/393003)
