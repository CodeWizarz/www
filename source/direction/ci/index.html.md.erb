# What we do

## CI Section Vision

Our **vision** is to experience [genericide](https://grammarist.com/new-words/genericide/) (similar to "Band-Aid", "Post-It", or "Xerox") for the building, testing, and packaging of software. What we mean by this, is that GitLab CI/CD as brand becomes the category name for how developers do CI/CD. We are going to accomplish this by making the process of configuring, managing, consuming, and proactively tuning CI/CD pipelines or the infrastructure as frictionless as possible. 

The CI Section is comprised of two stages: Verify and Package. For a deeper view of the direction of each specific stage please visit the respective Direction Pages linked below:
- [Verify](/direction/verify)
- [Package](/direction/package/)

### 3-year strategy 



### Market predictions 

In three years the CI market will:

* Consider CI a critical capability for bridging between Dev, Sec & Ops to create truly high-performing DevSecOps organizations
* Consider Package management an integrated requirement for any CI/CD platform
* CI will emerge as a critical lever for operational excellence in businesses 
* Demand a higher standard of security outputs in the build processes 
* AI in the automation of infrastructure and development best-practices will be a new domain worth leading the market in 

### Themes

The CI Section is contributing actively to our [Yearly Themes](/direction/#fy24-product-investment-themes). In FY24, we plan to execute on:

1. World-class DevSecOps by delivering [GitLab Events](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8349), [CI/CD Catalog](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7462), expanding the [Maven Dependency Proxy](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/3610) and prioritizing usability of our key workflows 
1. Advanced security and compliance by delivering [SLSA L3 framework requirements](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/supply-chain/#current-position-and-vision), including Container and Package scanning, improving our connections to Google Artifact Registry, and investing in [Secrets Management Direction](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/verify/secrets_management/)
1. Observability, analytics, & feedback via our investment in [Runner Fleet](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/verify/runner_fleet/)
