## Overview
The AI Research category aims to identify and explore AI/ML models to support use cases other GitLab sections, stages, groups are developing to enrich the DevSecOps experience for GitLab users. 

We continuously evaluate AI/ML model vendors, open source models, and generative AI foundation models. Models that show promising results from our initial research and exploration will be further tested via the [AI Evaluation](../ai_evaluation/) platform to be compared against models already supported in our [AI Framework](../../ai_framework/) and that are actively powering [GitLab Duo](https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-duo/) features. 

### Evaluation Criteria 
We evaluate models with a wide range of criteria to support our enterprise customer's needs including: 

- Model capabilities 
- Model interface 
- Data Governance policies 
- Security
- Deployment options 
- Track record of organization offering the model 
- And more
