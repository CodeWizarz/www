### Introduction and how you can help
<!-- Introduce yourself and the category. Use this as an opportunity to point users to the right places for contributing and collaborating with you as the PM -->

Thanks for visiting this category direction page on GitLab Duo Chat. This page belongs to the [Duo Chat group](/direction/ai-powered/duo_chat) of the AI-powered stage and is maintained by [Torsten Linz](https://gitlab.com/tlinz) ([email](mailto:tlinz@gitlab.com>)).

This direction page is a work in progress, and everyone can contribute to our vision, architecture, and designs by commenting on the epic for the [GitLab Chat Bot](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/10219) and its sub-epics and issues.  

 - Sharing your feedback directly on GitLab.com is the best way to contribute to our strategy and vision.
 - Alternatively, feel free to share feedback directly via [email](mailto:tlinz@gitlab.com>), or on a video call. If you're a GitLab user and have direct knowledge of your need for AI support, we'd especially love to hear from you.


### Overview
<!-- Describe your category so that someone who is not familiar with the market space can understand what the product does. 
-->
The recent advent of very capable large language models presents an opportunity to improve the way users interact with data. It is now possible to employ such AI models to let users interactively explore data with via natural language. 

The vision: GitLab Duo Chat is a conversational AI assistant that simplifies tasks and reducing context switches to empower users to achieve their DevSecOps goals faster and streamlined. 

Initially, Chat will be limited in the types of queries it can answer. Long-term we intend for Chat to also be able to carry out tasks for the user. 

### Strategy and Themes
<!-- Capture the main problems to be solved in market (themes). Describe how you intend to solve these with GitLab (strategy). Provide enough context that someone unfamiliar with the details of the category can understand what is being discussed. -->

Let's face it DevSecOps tasks are hard and complex. Understanding code that others have written, comprehending reported vulnerabilities, reading through tons of comments, understanding why a pipeline failed. And this is just the beginning, after all one wants contribute to such code, fix the vulnerability, draw conclusions from the comments, and fix the pipeline. 

Yes, such work is being done every day by developers, security professionals, product managers, and all the other personas that work in the DevSecOps space. However, they could do all these tasks much more efficiently and with less context switching with the help of AI. 

Our strategy with GitLab Duo Chat is to make it fully aware of the context the user has to be a truly helpful assistant. We intend for GitLab Duo Chat to:
- answer predefined as well as open questions relating to the user's data in GitLab 
- be able to explain how to use GitLab
- generate content & code for the user
- have context of what the user currently sees and everything else the user has access to
- have context of the recent conversation history with the user
- employ a large language model to decide which of this data is relevant and to generate an answer the user's question
- and be available to the user in GitLab's web UI, WebIDE, and popular IDEs.

For this to scale across the entire our vast DevSecOps platform, the AI Framework team will focus on build the basic chat system to enable others GitLab teams as well as contributors to bring additional context to the chat to enable new use cases. 

Here are just a few examples of questions that users may want to ask. A longer list can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/10550#what-the-user-can-ask).

Questions related to current code
- Can you explain the code? 
- Please, write me tests for this function?
- How would you refactor the code?
- Can you fix the bug in my code
- Please, write documentation for the selected code
- Can you create a tic tac toe game in Javascript

Questions related to the current issue
- Please, summarize the issue.
- Can you identify all the unique user needs raised in comments in this issue?

- How do I create a template?

### 1 year plan
<!--
1 year plan for what we will be working on linked to up-to-date epics. This section will be most similar to a "road-map". Items in this section should be linked to issues or epics that are up to date. Indicate relative priority of initiatives in this section so that the audience understands the sequence in which you intend to work on them. 
 -->
Coming soon

#### What is next for us
<!-- This is a 3 month look ahead for the next iteration that you have planned for the category. This section must provide links to issues or
or to [epics](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-processes/#epics-for-a-single-iteration) that are scoped to a single iteration. Please do not link to epics encompass a vision that is a longer horizon and don't lay out an iteration plan. -->
- [GitLab Duo Chat Beta release](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/10550)

#### What we are currently working on
<!-- Scoped to the current month. This section can contain the items that you choose to highlight on the kickoff call. Only link to issues, not Epics.  -->
- [Planning issue for GitLab Duo Chat 16.4](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/422249) 

#### What we recently completed
<!-- Lookback limited to 3 months. Link to the relevant issues or release post items. -->
- Beginning of August we released the initial experimental version of [GitLab Duo Chat](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/ai_features.html#gitlab-duo-chat) on SaaS.

#### What is Not Planned Right Now
<!--  Often it's just as important to talk about what you're not doing as it is to
discuss what you are. This section should include items that people might hope or think
we are working on as part of the category, but aren't, and it should help them understand why that's the case.
Also, thinking through these items can often help you catch something that you should
in fact do. We should limit this to a few items that are at a high enough level so
someone with not a lot of detailed information about the product can understand -->
 More details soon.

### Best in Class Landscape
<!-- Blanket description consistent across all pages that clarifies what GitLab means when we say "best in class" -->

<!-- BIC (Best In Class) is an indicator of forecasted near-term market performance based on a combination of factors, including analyst views, market news, and feedback from the sales and product teams. It is critical that we understand where GitLab appears in the BIC landscape. -->
Details coming soon. 

#### Key Capabilities 
<!-- For this product area, these are the capabilities a best-in-class solution should provide -->
Details coming soon. 

#### Roadmap
<!-- Key deliverables we're focusing on to build a BIC solution. List the epics by title and link to the epic in GitLab. Minimize additional description here so that the epics can remain the SSOT. This may be duplicative to the 1 year section however for some categories the key deliverables required to become the BIC solution will extend beyond one year and we want to capture all of the gaps. Moreover, the 1 year section may contain work that is not directly related to closing gaps if we are already the BIC or if we are differentiating ourselves.-->
Details coming soon.

#### Top [1/2/3] Competitive Solutions
<!-- PMs can choose to highlight a primary BIC competitor--or more, if no single clear winner in the category exists; in this section we should indicate: 1. name of competitive product, 2. links to marketing website and documentation, 3. why we view them as the primary BIC competitor -->
Comptetitors in the space include Android Studio Bot, GitHub Copilot Chat, Tabnine Chat, and Sourcegraph's Cody AI Assistant. 

### Target Audience
<!--
List the personas (https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/strategic-marketing/roles-personas#user-personas) involved in this category.
