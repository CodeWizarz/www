## Purpose
This page is for high-level prioritization of the threat insights team for 17.0-17.11. It primarily includes feature/product items and is not a comprehensive list of everything that will be worked such as bugs, implementation issues, documentation, or technical debt. It is not intended as a replacement or alternative for our issue boards. It is meant as an easily consumable single view of the main in-progress and upcoming work items for the Threat Insights group. It also allows mixing Epics and Issues in a single list.  The tables come from the [threat_insights.yml](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/-/blob/master/data/product_priorities/threat_insights.yml) file.
This list is not a guarantee of timing or order of delivery. Rather, use this as a guide to see the tops items we are working on and will be in the near future. The list purposefully does not extend out beyond a year to minimize a false sense of priority.

<% data.product_priorities.threat_insights_17.priorities.select { |item| item.type == '~"type::feature"' }.each.with_index do |priority, index| %>
| <%= index + 1 %> | [<%= priority.name %>](<%= priority.url %>) | [`<%= priority.team || "TBD" %>`](/handbook/engineering/development/sec/govern/threat-insights/#how-we-work) | `<%= priority.target_release.presence || "TBD" %>`  |
<% end %>

### Technical debt and deprecations

| Priority | Name | Team| Target release |
