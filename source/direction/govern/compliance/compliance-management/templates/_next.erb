In %16.3, we rebranded our Compliance reports to "Compliance center". As we continue to grow our Complaince offering, the Compliance center will be the home for managing compliance reports, configuring frameworks, and more.

In %16.5, we'll be working on our first[ MVC for Compliance Standards Adherence Reporting](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/11052). As we build towards supporting multiple common regulatory standards and frameworks, we'll begin by implementing a few core common standards that span across industries and regulatory landscapes:

- Two person approvals on merge requests
- Confirmation that approvers on an MR cannot have also committed to an MR
- Confirmation that approvers on an MR cannot have authored an MR

Our Compliance Standards Adherence Reporting will continue to evolve to support the most common standards and frameworks leveraged by our customers. To share feedback on your use cases and the most important standards and compliance frameworks you'd like to see us support, feel free to comment [on our epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7854).

We'll be introducing [retries for status checks](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/11081), which will allow users to more seamlessly address MRs that may be blocked by a failed status check.

And, we'll be adding [export capabilities to our Compliance Violations](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/11067), allowing users to export a report about the violations configured, and the associated projects that have the the compliance framework label enabled. The copy of this file can be maintained as a source of truth for the ideal state of the relationship between compliance violations and which projects have these violations.
