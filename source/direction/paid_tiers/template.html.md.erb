title: Upcoming features for paid tiers
---

The list is an outline of Direction issues coming up in each paid [tier](/pricing/). These are **tentpole features** -- the most important features
of upcoming releases -- and don't include most contributions from volunteers
outside the company. You can also view features organized by [upcoming releases](/upcoming-releases/) or [past releases](/releases/).

Note that we often move things around, do things that are not listed, and cancel
things that _are_ listed. Some of the things listed here might not ever be in
GitLab. This is our best estimate of where new features will land, but is in no
way definitive.

## Paid tiers

### Premium

Premium features are only available to Premium (and Ultimate) subscribers.
