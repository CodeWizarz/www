To support our goals in 2020 and our [3-year strategy](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/ops/#3-year-strategy), Monitor will continue enriching the free features while adding tier value focusing on Incident Management. While investing in the reduction of barriers to entry into Monitor, we will spend time meeting the needs of the Enterprise by adding visibility into the benefits of using GitLab end-to-end. 

##### Free
Monitor will continue investing in the free solution which enables users to set up foundational incident management workflows directly in GitLab.
Features in this tier include:

- Alert integrations for generic HTTP Endpoints and an external Prometheus integration.
- Manually created incidents
- Linking runbooks to alerts via an alert URL

##### Premium
As the default paid tier for enterprises, Premium will cater to directors operating a medium to large instance. We'll direct features that solve for typical entry-level enterprise needs: with alert integrations, incident issues native to GitLab, on-call schedule management, escalation policies and runbooks.  While this type of organization should be able to get started in GitLab at lower tiers, they won't be able to thrive at scale.  Premium will offer features that enable directors to integrate their monitor tools. Features targeted for this tier include:

- Multiple HTTP endpoints for alert integrations
- Custom mapping for alert formats and endpoints
- Automated incident creation based on a specified criteria, i.e. incident severity
- On-call schedules and escalation policies
- Rendering linked runbooks in alerts and incidents

##### Ultimate
Monitor will direct capabilities into Ultimate which serve the organizational needs of a complex enterprise operating a large GitLab instance.  Ultimate users will gain efficiency with all of their different tools working well together within and as a part of GitLab. Roadmap features targeted for this tier include:

- Bi-directional, out of the box integrations with popular monitor tools
- Incident payload transformations
- Routing for alerts
- Incident timelines
