## Overview
A common need for many companies is to communicate the availability of a software service they provide. This could be to internal users, customers, or the general public. These will be collectively referred to as **Stakeholders**. A typical Status Page publicly lists services that it provides and the **status** of that service. It's main purpose is for Stakeholders to self-serve information to determine if a service is unavailable while internal teams work to restore services that have been disrupted. In the event there is an outage, the Status Page also provides explanation for the outages as well as any known timelines for restoration. Stakeholders generally have the option of subscribing to different services to be proactively alerted to changes in Status.

In an age where systems must be [highly available](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_availability) and uptime is guaranteed on the order of [six 9's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_availability#%22Nines%22), it's crucial that the time and effort of response teams are not wasted updating Stakeholders in multiple ways.
