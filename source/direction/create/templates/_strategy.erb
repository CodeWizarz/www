In three years the Create stage market will:
   - Still be focused on Git as the superior version-control system
   - Evolve [Git](https://git-scm.com/) to efficiently support monorepos and take market in the movie and video game industry from other version control systems
   - Experience enormous performance and accuracy leaps in code search
   - Incoporate ML/AI in the writing of code
      - AI backed smart recommendation engines, such as Chat GPT by openai.com, will provide in line recommendations to developers as they work
      - AI engines will be able to convert human language prompts into simple applications
   - Embrace cloud-based development environments
   - See a [rise](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-02-15-gartner-forecasts-worldwide-low-code-development-technologies-market-to-grow-23-percent-in-2021) in the [citizen developer](https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/citizen-developer) via no code, low code platforms

As a result, in three years GitLab will:
   - Be the market default tool for [Source Code management](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/create/source_code_management/source_code_management/) in all industries including Entertainment and other sectors that depend upon binary assets
   - [Provide strong support for monorepos](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/773) by extending commands and workflows in git that make working with enourmous repositories fast and efficient
   - Provide a [browser-based IDE](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/create/ide/remote_development/) that provides reliable and secure access to pre-configured development environments
   - Offer an optional add-on for developers to use AI assistance while coding to provide recommendatons for more performant and more secure code
   - Serve the [citizen developer](https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/citizen-developer) via tools that reduce the barrier to entry for developers that have not been formally trained starting with low code options that may eventually include an AI option to convert human language into simple applications 
   - Integrations with game development platforms
