## The IDE group

**Content last reviewed on 2023-09-07**

This is the direction page for the IDE group which is part of the [Create stage](/direction/dev/index.html#create) of the DevOps lifecycle and is responsible for: 

|  Category   |   Direction  |  Description | Maturity  |
|  ---   |   ---   |   ---   |  ---  |
| Web IDE | [Direction page](/direction/create/ide/web_ide/) | A web-based multi-file code editor |  [Viable](/direction/maturity/) |
| Remote Development | [Direction page](/direction/create/ide/remote_development/) | Server-side runtime environments | [Planned](/direction/maturity/) |
| GitLab Workflow for Visual Studio Code | [Strategy epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7206) | Official GitLab extension for VS Code | N/A |

## What are we working on and why?

### Web IDE 

The GitLab Web IDE is a powerful browser-based multi-file editor based on the open source [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) project. As an entirely client-side solution, the Web IDE does not consume any additional server or database resources or require any additional configuration to get started. Developers and non-developers alike can quickly access a project's entire file system and commit directly from their web browser. 

While the VS Code-based Web IDE is in Beta we are looking to improve the [commit](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-web-ide/-/issues/72) and [code review](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/386256) experiences, introduce the [ability to install VS Code extensions](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/7685), and address [feeback gathered in the Beta stage](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/385787). 

### Remote Development 

While the Web IDE makes it possible for anyone to contribute to a project right from their web browser, editing the actual code is only a small part of a developer's workflow. Local IDEs, combined with properly-configured development environments, make it possible to run tests, lint code, generate previews, and offer features that improve developer efficiency like code completion. Without these productivity-boosting features, developers won't fully adopt a tool. 

Remote Development workspaces provide a server-based runtime environment that can be accessed from the Web IDE or your local IDE, eliminating the need for managing a complex set of dependencies on your local machine. These workspaces are defined in code and deployed as needed on a cloud provider via the GitLab Agent for Kubernetes.
