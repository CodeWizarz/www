## Gitter

_Last updated 2020-10-07_

Gitter is an open source chat application for developers, and is the place to connect the open source and software development community.

In September 2020, [Gitter was acquired](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2020/09/30/gitter-moves-to-element/) by [Element](https://element.io/) which will continue to support and invest in the Gitter community as part of their secure and decentralized messaging network, [Matrix](https://matrix.org/). Matrix has published a [detailed transition plan](https://matrix.org/blog/2020/09/30/welcoming-gitter-to-matrix) and welcomes [feedback on the process](https://matrix.to/#/#gitter:matrix.org).
