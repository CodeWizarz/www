### Introduction and how you can help
<!-- Introduce yourself and the category. Use this as an opportunity to point users to the right places for contributing and collaborating with you as the PM -->

The Source Code Management direction page belongs to the [Source Code](/handbook/product/categories/#source-code-group) group of the [Create](/stages-devops-lifecycle/create/) stage, and is maintained by [Derek Ferguson](https://gitlab.com/derekferguson), who can be reached at dferguson@gitlab.com.

This direction is a work in progress, and everyone can contribute. Sharing your feedback directly is the best way to contribute to our strategy and vision. Please, comment and contribute in the linked issues below, or to any other [issues](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/issues?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=group%3A%3Asource%20code) or [epics](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=opened&label_name[]=group%3A%3Asource%20code), or raise an issue yourself in [gitlab-org/gitlab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/) if you don't find existing feedback that matches your thoughts.

### Strategy and Themes
<!-- Describe your category. Capture the main problems to be solved in market (themes). Describe how you intend to solve these with GitLab (strategy). Provide enough context that someone unfamiliar with the details of the category can understand what is being discussed. -->
Source code management (SCM) is the foundation of an organization's software development practice.

Building great software depends on teams working well together. Teams can rarely be divided into areas of complete independence. As cross-functional security, compliance, and growth teams are formed, or new services and libraries are created, effective coordination and collaboration are essential.

To achieve this, teams need to protect production while making it easy for everyone to contribute. Source Code Management provides the controls to define the rules and workflows for this purpose:
- Who has the rights to view or change the code ([visibility](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/public_access.html); [members](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/members/); [permissions](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/permissions.html); [merge request approvals](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/approvals/index.html); [forking and mirroring](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/forking_workflow.html))
- Who owns the code and is responsible for it and thus has the right to approve changes to it ([codeowners](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/codeowners/); [merge request approvals](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/approvals/index.html))
- Which quality tests must be passed before changes can be applied ([coverage checks](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/settings.html#coverage-check-approval-rule); [security checks](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/policies/scan-result-policies.html))
- Which branches need to be protected because they influence production ([default branch](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/branches/default.html); [protected branches](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/protected_branches.html); [push rules](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/push_rules.html))


#### Themes
While the principles have been around for half a century, SCM is not without challenges. SCM needs to address a large set of requirements that are partly contradicting:
- encourage sound development practices
- but also, be flexible enough to adjust to varying workflows
- be intuitive
- but also, be secure and ensure compliance
- be fast and reliable
- but easy to manage

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is the leading Version Control System (VCS) and is loved by developers. It excels at tracking changes in source code and makes it easy and transparent to merge changes from different developers into one code base. GitLab's source code management builds on top of Git adding functionality that aims to address the above requirements. For example, access control to code repositories or requiring code reviews before merging changes. Source code management and the create stage represent the most popular features in GitLab.

Yet, despite their appeal, neither Git nor GitLab SCM are perfect. Here are the current main shortcomings:
- GitLab's SCM UX, has shown to be partly unintuitive or uninformative. For instance, controls to enforce rules are hard to discover and understand.
- Git is not particularly good at working with binary files such as graphics or video content common in game development. With those media files, Git cannot interpret change on a granular level as it does with text files. So, it needs to store full copies of every new version of a media file.
- While [Git Large File Storage (LFS)](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/git/lfs/) aims to address this, the Git process - as helpful as it is for developers - appears complex from a content creator's perspective. Especially as they cannot benefit in the same way from Git as developers do for the lack of diffability of media files.
- Finally, Git gets slow when repositories become exceptionally large (even if they do not contain binary files). While not common such so-called monorepos are used in several large tech companies. [Partial clone](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/git/partial_clone.html) addresses some of the issues.

#### Strategy
Therefore, the vision for Source Code Management at GitLab consists of three pillars:
- Make it easy and intuitive to manage source code so that it is secure, compliant, and encourages best development practices.
- Make it easy to work with large binary files in GitLab. And make it easy for content creators to contribute media files to GitLab to enable better collaboration with developers to support [GitLab's mission](https://about.gitlab.com/company/mission/#mission): everyone can contribute!
- Make it easy to work with [monorepos](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/monorepos/) in GitLab: [&8262](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8262). (Note, this also touches other stages, especially the Verify stage).

Note: SCM is not only the most used function in GitLab but also the one with the longest history as it has been there from the beginning. As a result, we get a lot of feedback and have a long backlog of issues. Therefore, we need to spend a considerable share of our teams’ capacity on issues that are not at the center of this vision but address bugs, stability, security, and scalability to keep our users and customers happy.


### 1 year plan

<!--1 year plan for what we will be working on linked to up-to-date epics. This section will be most similar to a "road-map". Items in this section should be linked to issues or epics that are up to date. Indicate relative priority of initiatives in this section so that the audience understands the sequence in which you intend to work on them. -->

- Improve experience with branch protections, approval rules, security approvals and status checks in project settings: [Edit source code rules organized by branches](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8075) 
- Continue to improve experience with CODEOWNERS: 
   - [Help users better understand CODEOWNERS](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4498)
   - [Enhance CODEOWNERS to enable mapping of review processes of larger organizations and organizations that use a monorepo](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9774) such as [allowing larger organizations to manager their Codeowners via multiple Codeowner files](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/199203) for a better separation of responsibilities across their organization. 

To be extended.

#### What is next for us
<!-- This is a 3 month look ahead for the next iteration that you have planned for the category. This section must provide links to issues or
or to [epics](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/product/product-processes/#epics-for-a-single-iteration) that are scoped to a single iteration. Please do not link to epics encompass a vision that is a longer horizon and don't lay out an iteration plan. -->

- Continue to Improve the discoverability of branch rules: [Enable E2E workflow for setting branch rules - from discovery to changing the rule](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/9810)
- Continue to improve experience with CODEOWNERS by [helping users better understand CODEOWNERS](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/4498)
- Fix 9 most customer requested bugs in FY24 Q2
- Transparency on [statistics for frequency of clones](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/15807). This is especially helpful for understanding popularity of open source projects.


#### What we are currently working on
<!-- Scoped to the current month. This section can contain the items that you choose to highlight on the kickoff call. Only link to issues, not Epics.  -->

<!-- 16.2: -->
- Improve the experience with CODEOWNERS by showing potential syntax errors in the file: 
   - [CODEOWNERS syntax/format validation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/216066)
   - [Syntax highlighting for CODEOWNERS file in the Web IDE (VSCode)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/396603)
- Improve UX: [Better clarity and transparency when comparing branches](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/377957)
- An iteration on our AI experiment: [Natural language assistant for creating git commands in CLI: copy the command rather than execute it](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/414276)

#### What we recently completed
<!-- Lookback limited to 3 months. Link to the relevant issues or release post items. -->

- [Fetch new upstream contents when fork is behind](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/330243): Managing your fork just got easier. When your fork is behind, select Update fork to catch it up with upstream changes. When your fork is ahead, select Create merge request to contribute your change back to the upstream project. Both operations previously required you to use the command line.

  See how many commits your fork is ahead (or behind) on your project's main page and at Repository > Files. If merge conflicts exist, the UI gives guidance on how to resolve them using Git from the command line.

- [Better display of tags and branches in commit detail view](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/325871): In the commit detail view, you can now see at a glance the tag(s) a commit has been tagged with (if at all) and the list of branches that have the commit at the tip. This can for instance help you contextualize the commit with information from the tag (e.g. critical-hot-fix).

  You can further expand the UI elements to see the list of tags and branches that contain the commit in their history. This helps you for instance to understand the list of branches a commit that introduced a bug has propagated to, to know in which you have to revert the commit.

- [Mirror specific branches only](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/1893): Do you need to mirror a busy repository with many branches, but you only need a few of them? Limit the number of branches you mirror by creating a regular expression that matches only the branches you need.

  Previously, mirrors required you to mirror an entire repository, or all protected branches. This new flexibility can decrease the amount of data your mirrors push or pull, and keep sensitive branches out of public mirrors.

- [Branch rule overview](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8578): All branch-related protections now display on a single page. To see a unified list of your branches and all their protection methods, go to Settings > Repository > Branch rules. Each branch shows the merge request approvals, security approvals, protected branches, and status checks configured for it. Previously, these settings were grouped by type, making it tough to see a holistic view of a specific branch’s protections.

- [Better display of tags in commits list view](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/18795): Identifying commits that have been tagged just got simpler. View the commits list at Repository > Commits to see commits with their tags attached. This view helps you understand what commits have been added since a tagged release commit.

- [Require multiple approvals from CODEOWNERS](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/335451): You can now precisely define for which files, file types, or directories approval has been designated as optional, required approval by 1 user or required approval by multiple users. The latter being the new improvement of CODEOWNERS.

  So far, if you needed to require multiple approvers be it for compliance reasons or other reasons, you could only do so with an approval rule. However, unlike CODEOWNER approvals, approval rules apply to entire branches and cannot be refined to apply to specific parts of your code base. So, the multiple approvals would have also been required for changes that do not need a high level of scrutiny leading to unnecessary reviews. [See documentation.](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/codeowners/#require-multiple-approvals-from-code-owners)
- [More control over your SSH connections with gitlab-sshd](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5394): `gitlab-sshd` is a standalone SSH server, written in Go, that provides more insight and control than OpenSSH. It's lightweight and contains minimal external dependencies. If you host a self-managed instance, switching from OpenSSH to `gitlab-sshd` gives you metrics collection, detailed logging, and graceful shutdowns for SSH connections. Unlike OpenSSH, it supports the PROXY protocol and can pass on the original IP address when operated behind a proxy. This enables you to [restrict SSH access by IP address](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/access_and_permissions.html#restrict-group-access-by-ip-address) when your instance is operated behind a proxy.

  GitLab.com has used `gitlab-sshd` since 15.2, and 100% of the SSH traffic passes through `gitlab-sshd`. To learn more, read [this blog post](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2022/08/17/why-we-have-implemented-our-own-sshd-solution-on-gitlab-sass/). To understand how to enable it refer to [the documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/operations/gitlab_sshd.html).

  `gitlab-sshd` began as a community contribution from @lorenz. Thank you very much for your contribution!



#### What is Not Planned Right Now
<!--  Often it's just as important to talk about what you're not doing as it is to
discuss what you are. This section should include items that people might hope or think
we are working on as part of the category, but aren't, and it should help them understand why that's the case.
Also, thinking through these items can often help you catch something that you should
in fact do. We should limit this to a few items that are at a high enough level so
someone with not a lot of detailed information about the product can understand -->

The Source Code group is not investing in the following opportunities in the immediate future:

- [Branch read access controls](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/720)

   Limiting which branches a user can read in a Git repository is possible in a basic sense, by only advertising a subset of refs, but it is not possible to guarantee that unreachable objects will not be sent to the client. This means that branch read access controls would be very weak, since they could not prevent exfiltration of data they do not have permission to read.

- Path-level read access controls

   From a commit, Git expects all trees and blobs to be reachable. Although Git supports partial clone and spares checkout, which allow data to be excluded from fetch and checkout, Git expects to be able to fetch missing objects on demand. Deliberately excluding objects by path is likely to cause unexpected failures.
   
- [Report number of lines per language and/or per contributor](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8589)

  [Research](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/8589#note_1462211450) has shown that reporting the lines of code contributed could hurt individual users as this has a tendency to be misused as a false measure of contribution. Counting the lines of code per language in a repository has shown to be a nice-to-have and can therefore not be prioritized against more important featuers on the roadmap above. 

- Improvements to [Project Templates](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/2767)

   Due to other priorities, we won't be able to progress [Project templates](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/custom_project_templates.html) in 2023. 


### Best in Class Landscape
<!-- Blanket description consistent across all pages that clarifies what GitLab means when we say "best in class" -->
BIC (Best In Class) is an indicator of forecasted near-term market performance based on a combination of factors, including analyst views, market news, and feedback from the sales and product teams. It is critical that we understand where GitLab appears in the BIC landscape.

#### Key Capabilities
<!-- For this product area, these are the capabilities a best-in-class solution should provide -->

This information is maintained on [this internal handbook page](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/product/best-in-class/create/#source-code-management)

#### Roadmap
<!-- Key deliverables we're focusing on to build a BIC solution. List the epics by title and link to the epic in GitLab. Minimize additional description here so that the epics can remain the SSOT. -->
