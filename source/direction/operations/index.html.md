## What's next & why
- [Incident management](/direction/monitor/#incident-management)

## Key Themes
- [Application metrics](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/534)
- [Cluster cost optimization](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/503)
- [Kubernetes configuration](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/115)
- [Operations dashboard](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/642)

- [Monitor](/direction/monitor/)
- [Configure](/direction/delivery/)
