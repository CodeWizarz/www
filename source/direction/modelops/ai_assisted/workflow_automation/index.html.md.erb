## Overview

- *Workflow Automation* → Automatic generation of new Issues and merge requests as well as automatic labeling and label tracking. This includes identifying and assigning code reviewer assignments automatically. Our customers are looking for us to help them streamline their processes and deliver their software faster. This is our first focus as we can easily dogfood these capabilities as they are implemented. 
    - Current examples include proper labeling of issues based on issue content, finding the right code-reviewers to review code, automatically trimming or expanding the CI/CD pipeline based on learned past behavior, and helping users find "related issues even if they are not linked explicitly".
    - Future examples include helping users “be more polite and inclusive in their responses to issues", and "helping people write complete and better issues by using NLP techniques".
