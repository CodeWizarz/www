## Overview

- *Intelligent Code Security* → Automatic detection of insecure coding (e.g., code quality) as well as automatic remediation of insecure coding / security vulnerabilities. This will enable us to provide “auto-healing” as well as empower customers with solutions so they can reduce future insecure coding practices. Our customers are asking us to partner with them to reduce their overall risk. This is our final focus and will expand our capabilities in the Verify and Secure stages. 
    - Examples include "auto-suggesting remedies and fixes to configuration" based on what we have learned from source code history and leveraging knowledge from abstract code graphs at scale to prevent others from running into the same issues the "ticket-reporting" customer ran into.
