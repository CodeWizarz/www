### Remote Development

Local dev environments can be tricky to set up and often require hours to troubleshoot to set up development kits. Even when successfully configured, the "works on my machine" problem can arise as there are likely many differences between production and local environments.

We believe remote development will become a more popular development paradigm over the next few years and will manifest itself in this way: devs will code in places they are comfortable, such as local IDEs and will run code in Kubernetes environments that their IDE is connected to. [Okteto](https://okteto.com/) is an interesting tool that is solving for this right now.

GitLab is uniquely positioned to serve as a remote development environment as we have a tight integration with Kubernetes as well as a VSCode Plugin in addition to an in-app editing experience in our Web IDE.

As examples, GitLab will provide:

* Remote dev environments powered by Kubernetes
* Remote dev environments that can be connected to a local VSCode editor
* Remove dev environments that can be connected to the Web IDE or a GitLab project
