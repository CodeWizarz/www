##### Set yourself up for success
The Digital Experience team who work on the marketing website are primarily responsible for facilitating content, not creating it. Please prepare a content plan:

- Provide the layout you think would work best from existing pages or existing blocks
  - You can use the [Blocks section in Slippers](https://www.figma.com/file/nWIOpmuMp7RZXmfTj6ujAF/Slippers_foundations?node-id=1280%3A62) to "shop" for blocks and gear your content to designs that already exist.
  - This youtube video shows [how to navigate the Slippers Figma file](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbnxXE4PT_s) and how a content doc can work with the blocks.
  - Not sure what a "block" is? You can read about that and more on our [Digital Definitions](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/marketing/digital-experience/digital-definitions/#blocks) handbook page.
- Provide the content in the layout of the existing block or page template
  - Use this [Content + DSN Block Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c2OYCtT57SACYSt55YMB5ZW-rt-JFw5RxYNWKPZt-Ao/edit?usp=sharing) as a base. This template allows you to input [existing block designs](https://www.figma.com/file/nWIOpmuMp7RZXmfTj6ujAF/Slippers_foundations?node-id=1280%3A62) mentioned above.
  - This [Content Wireframe Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ypPJVNEpaSiafY0BnZ0p49tBfVeBGQnySVhgYE7gikk/edit?usp=sharing) is based on the current about.gitlab.com/enterprise page
- Provide all the files for images (assets, logos, etc.)
  - See [image guidelines](/handbook/marketing/digital-experience/image-guidelines/) for specs
- Know the URL and keywords you want to use
   - SEO and keyword analysis from the Search Team [Issue Templates](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/inbound-marketing/growth/issues/new?issuable_template=keyword-research-request) is recommended.
   - See [naming conventions](/handbook/marketing/digital-experience/website/#naming-conventions)
- To officially begin the request submit a brief via an [Issue Template](/handbook/marketing/inbound-marketing/#website-issue-templates)
