##### Lead time

Requests should be made with sufficient lead time to process the request, allocate resources, iterate, and produce related items.

The time needed for your webpage request will vary on a number of factors, including, but not limited to: 
- The number of pages (URLs) being created
- The level of design work 
   - If you are using an existing page template from the design system 
   - If you are asking for complicated web design elements v. simple lists 
   - If you are able to provide all images for the page
- The level of content support 
- You or your team's ability to edit a webpage using GitLab
