          %h2 Overview
          %ul
            %li
              When development teams are spread across two or more geographical locations, but their
              GitLab instance is in a single location, fetching and cloning large repositories can take a long time.
            %li
              Built for distributed teams, GitLab Geo allows for read-only mirrors of your GitLab instance. Reduce
              the time it takes to clone and fetch large repos and improve your collaboration process.

          %h2 How it works
          %ul
            %li
              GitLab Geo is included in GitLab Enterprise Edition Premium.
            %li
              GitLab Geo allows for read-only mirrors of your GitLab instance.
            %li
              Project repositories and the database including user accounts,
              issues, merge requests, groups, project data, etc., are replicated on your secondary instance.
            %li
              With read-only mirrors, your team can fetch projects and read data much faster while still
              pushing all changes to the primary server.
            %li
              All replication operations are asynchronous and are queued to be dispatched as soon as they
              happen.

              %b Read-only secondaries:
              Maintain one primary GitLab instance while still enabling a read-only secondary
              instance for each of your distributed teams.
            %li
              %b Authentication system hooks:
              The secondary instance receives all authentication data, like user accounts
              and logins, from the primary instance.
            %li
              %b Intuitive UI:
              Secondaries utilize the same web interface your team has grown accustomed to. However, there
              are visual notifications that block write operations and make it clear that a user is on a
              secondary instance.

          %ul
            %li
              %b Time:
              Reduce the time it takes your distributed developers to clone and fetch large repos and
              projects from minutes to seconds.
            %li
              %b Collaboration:
              Enable all of your developers to contribute ideas and work in parallel from each of their
              respective geographies.
            %li
              %b Scale:
              Balance the load between your primary and secondary instance or offload your automated tests to the Geo secondary node.

Our primary code repository server is in Los Angeles. It was taking our Boston team 10 minutes to clone a single, large repo. Now with GitLab Geo, it takes under 30 seconds. The addition of GitLab Geo means our developers can be more productive.&rdquo;
