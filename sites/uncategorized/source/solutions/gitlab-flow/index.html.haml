      and enables safe, reliable, and fast distributed software development workflows by supporting branches to independently and safely work on features and bug fixes.

      The GitLab workflow facilitates improved team collaboration by accelerating ideas to production with features such as
      = link_to "Auto DevOps.", "/stages-devops-lifecycle/auto-devops/", :"data-ga-name" => "Auto dev ops", :"data-ga-location" => "body"
      GitLab Flow unites code version management with project and deployment management tools in order to create the easiest way to work with Git. While development teams can continue to seamlessly use Git, all team members can adopt easy-to-use features to simplify workflows and releases, enabling everyone to participate in a

      transformation as an organization scales.

      %h3 Environment branches for stability
      %p GitLab Flow provisions multiple environments like staging, pre-production, and production by using separate dedicated branches so that commits flow downstream to ensure that everything has been tested on all environments.

      %h3 Merge requests for feedback
      %p The GitLab merge request workflow serves as a code review tool, allowing team members to comment in general or on specific lines. If the review reveals shortcomings, anyone can contribute, depending on access level, by either committing to the same branch or forking the branch to create a new merge request.
    .tile
      %h3 Issue tracking for transparency
      %p GitLab Flow integrates the Git workflow with an issue tracking system, so that changes to the code start with an issue where goals are described, helping people keep the scope of a feature branch small.

          Gitflow is overly complex, Github-Flow leaves you with unanswered questions about lifecycle. Checkout Gitlab Flow :

          GitLab Flow has some nice alternatives to the typical naming conventions we see for branches.
