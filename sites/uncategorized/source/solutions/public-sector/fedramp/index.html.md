## What is FedRAMP?

The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) is a government-wide program that provides a standardized approach to security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services. [See the GSA definition.](https://www.gsa.gov/technology/government-it-initiatives/fedramp)   

Details about the [FedRAMP program](https://www.fedramp.gov/) highlight the process and status of how cloud services are assessed and certified in the [FedRAMP marketplace.](https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/#/products?sort=productName)

## GitLab and FedRAMP

GitLab is **both** a product that you can host (self-managed) and a cloud service that we host (SaaS). GitLab is pursuing FedRAMP Moderate authorization.  When we have an expected timeline for achieving FedRAMP-authorized status, we will add it to our product roadmap.  In the meantime, customers are able to deploy GitLab into their FedRAMP authorization boundary including [AWS](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/install/aws/){:data-ga-name="AWS"}{:data-ga-location="body"}, [Google Cloud](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/install/google_cloud_platform/index.html){:data-ga-name="Google cloud"}{:data-ga-location="body"}, [Azure](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/install/azure/index.html){:data-ga-name="Azure"}{:data-ga-location="body"}, or on-prem/data center.  GitLab provides [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/fips_compliance.html#fips-compliance) on how to install a FIPS-compliant version of our software.
