**SAN FRANCISCO, CA — August 7, 2019 —** Today [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), the DevOps platform delivered as a single application, announced initial programming and speakers for [2019 GitLab Commit Brooklyn](https://about.gitlab.com/events/commit/), taking place September 17 in Brooklyn, NY.

GitLab Commit, GitLab's inaugural user event, will bring together the GitLab community to connect, learn, and inspire. Speakers will showcase the power of DevOps in action through strategy and technology discussions, lessons learned, behind-the-scenes looks at the development lifecycle, and more. 

“GitLab Commit was created to be a home for DevOps learning and collaboration. To bring developers, operations and security professionals together to share best practices and lessons learned with one another in hopes this will make the development and open source community better,” said Sid Sijbrandij, CEO and co-founder of GitLab. “Through shared experiences and collaboration at the conference, we envision furthering DevOps transformations and adoption.”

**Conference Sessions and Speakers**
 
The conference agenda features a mix of topics, including technical sessions, deep-dives, and case studies covering cloud native, Kubernetes, CI/CD, DataOps, open source culture, security, all-remote, and more.
 
“It was an honor to review CFP submissions for GitLab’s inaugural user conference and quite exciting to see submissions from the community that span across cloud native, security and data engineering,” said George Tsiolis, UX Engineer and core contributor to GitLab. “I am looking forward to meeting people from the GitLab community, talk about real-world case scenarios, and learn how they utilize GitLab along with other open-source projects like Kubernetes and Terraform.”
