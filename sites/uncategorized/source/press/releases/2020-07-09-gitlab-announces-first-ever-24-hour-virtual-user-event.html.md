_GitLab Commit - Virtual will feature talks by Microsoft, the U.S. Air Force and Army, GNOME Foundation, Google, and more, showcasing the power of DevOps in action_

**SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA — July 9, 2020** - [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/events/commit/), the single application for the DevOps lifecycle, today announced initial programming and speakers for its GitLab Commit - Virtual event. GitLab’s first-ever 24-hour virtual learning experience, taking place on August 26, 2020, will be a free-for-attendee event filled with DevOps strategies and stories. 

GitLab Commit, GitLab's user event, brings together the GitLab community to connect, learn, and inspire. Speakers showcase the power of community and share DevOps best practices through strategy and technology discussions, lessons learned, behind-the-scenes looks at the development lifecycle, and more.

“This year, [#GitLabCommit](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GitLabCommit?src=hashtag_click) is going virtual. But we're not stopping there! We think everyone belongs at [@gitlab](https://twitter.com/gitlab), so this year you can attend for free.” - [@sytses](https://twitter.com/gitlab)

“GitLab Commit was created to be a home for DevOps learning and collaboration and tailored with the end-user in mind,” said John Jeremiah, Product Marketing Manager at GitLab. “At GitLab, we believe that anyone can contribute. This event will offer the opportunity for attendees around the world to participate and contribute, no matter what time zone they’re in.”

“We’re eager to connect with our growing community at this year’s Commit,” said Nuritzi Sanchez, GitLab’s Sr. Open Source Program Manager. “We hit some important milestones this year. We welcomed more than 3,000 contributors to our open source project and saw large open source organizations like [KDE](https://kde.org/) and [Xfce](https://www.xfce.org/) migrate to GitLab. We’re looking forward to personally connecting with our community and sharing updates on the work we’re doing to support them.”

In addition to conversations and educational sessions geared toward DevOps growth, development, and success, GitLab Commit - Virtual will also feature a number of talks on remote work, virtual jobs, and the impact of COVID-19 on the future of work.

“The great remote migration has thrust millions into a new environment,” said Darren Murph, Head of Remote at GitLab. “Some of the world's most progressive remote leaders will leverage Commit to educate and advocate, sharing tactical tips for thriving in a post-office paradigm.”

GitLab Commit attendees will receive a deep dive into how enterprises are transforming DevOps at an organizational level and how they can go back to their organization and implement similar practices. Attendees will also hear about problems solved, cultures changed, and release times halved. But, equally important, attendees will find a community of people that is passionate about DevOps. 

#### Conference Sessions and Speakers
The agenda for GitLab Commit features a mix of topics, including technical sessions, live coding, deep-dives, and case studies covering DevSecOps, Containers, Kubernetes, CI/CD, open source, all-remote, and more.
