**SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA — December 6, 2019 —** Today [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), the DevOps platform delivered as a single application, announced initial programming and speakers for [2020 GitLab Commit San Francisco](https://about.gitlab.com/events/commit/), taking place January 14 in San Francisco, CA.

GitLab Commit, GitLab's user event, brings together the GitLab community to connect, learn, and inspire. Speakers showcase the power of community and sharing DevOps best practices through strategy and technology discussions, lessons learned, behind-the-scenes looks at the development lifecycle, and more.

“GitLab Commit was created to be a home for DevOps learning and collaboration,” said Sid Sijbrandij, CEO and co-founder of GitLab. “These events bring together developers, operations experts, and security professionals to share best practices and lessons learned. We hope our attendees are inspired to take these learnings back to their own companies and further push the future and possibilities of DevOps.”

**Conference Sessions and Speakers**

The conference agenda features a mix of topics, including sessions on changing the software development lifecycle, technical deep-dives, and case studies covering cloud-native, Kubernetes, CI/CD, DataOps, open source culture, security, all-remote, and more.

“We received many creative and detailed submissions from some truly incredible people,” said Priyanka Sharma, Director of Technical Evangelism at GitLab. “Because of this, choosing our roster of speakers was not easy, but I’m excited to hear how our speakers overcame their unique technical challenges and the creative solutions they used.”
