_Strengthening cloud-based software development support, etc._

[GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), which implemented the whole life cycle of DevOps into a single application, has announced on the 21st a partnership with [Megazone Cloud](https://www.megazone.com/us/)(CEO: Joowan Lee), the largest cloud managed service provider (MSP) in Korea, to promote cloud conversion among Korean companies and the optimization of the cloud native.  

As a result, enterprise customers of GitLab and Megazone Cloud can now achieve cloud native through optimized cloud environments, namely, DevOps, continuous integration/delivery (CI/CD), container, and microservice architecture, which are beyond the simple migration of operating environments to the cloud. The two companies are scheduled to introduce the cloud native concept, targeting enterprise customers who adopted the cloud. GitLab and Megazone Cloud will also provide optimized programs for the information technology environment of each enterprise.

Through the partnership, Megazone Cloud will build competence in supporting software development for enterprise customers and will complement existing cloud-operating tools. As such, the company is now equipped with a specialized software product portfolio that will evaluate the consulting and performance capabilities for customers.

GitLab provides a tool that implements all the life cycle phases of DevOps into a single application, integrating the teams responsible for enterprise product development, quality assurance, security, and operation. In particular, the company operates through a complete open-source model and occupies 70% of the installation-type DevOps repository market.

Cloud native is a model that produces and operates apps using cloud container technology provided by Amazon Web Service (AWS), Microsoft (MS) Azure, etc. With cloud native, companies can reduce the time and cost spent in cloud environment maintenance.

GitLab implemented the whole life cycle phases of DevOps into a single app for companies that want to achieve the cloud native to manage the whole life cycles, from development to operation. In particular, GitLab is an open core company which develops software for the software development lifecycle, making the platform easily integrated with other existing applications. Moreover, it aims for the integration of development environments. 

GitLab’s strategy, through its partnership with Megazone Cloud, is to expand the cloud native concept, solidify the leadership, and strengthen the relationship with enterprise customers in Korea. The latest development and operation methodologies, such as CI/CD and DevOps, are gaining popularity in overseas markets because these methods increase work performance between departments. However, those methodologies remain at the laboratory level in Korea except for a few leading companies. As such, GitLab, in cooperation with Megazone Cloud, plans to expand the cloud native market in Korea based on prolific local and overseas cases and support experiences.

Director Woosang Lee, who leads the Strategic Account Division in GitLab Korea, said that “Now, we can approach more enterprise customers as we develop the cooperation relationship with Megazone, the largest cloud MSP in Asia. We will strengthen support, targeting the fields where GitLab is emerging as a top global group, such as CI/CD and DevOps.”

Joowan Lee, the CEO of Megazone Cloud, stated, “GitLab is leading the evolution of DevOps by reducing software development phases based on the cloud through a single tool, which optimizes work efficiency and easily integrates existing tools.” Lee also stressed that “Megazone will pioneer the market to promote DevOps and cloud native computing, hand in hand with GitLab.”

Since then, it was selected as the premier consulting partner and had, for the first time, received the best partner rating of AWS in 2015.

Megazone Cloud serves more than 1,500 companies, ranging from conglomerates, to financial institutions, to startup companies. Moreover, its revenue in 2019 was approximately KRW 410 billion.
