**SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA - March 23, 2021** — [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), the open DevOps platform and one of the world’s largest all-remote companies, announced today the [Call for Proposals (CFP) for Virtual GitLab Commit 2021](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYAnbBeMezbC_ZeqcTo31UHEKRhhem0wxEalM7Oy9KS3-j0w/viewform), taking place online August 3 and 4. 

[GitLab Commit](https://about.gitlab.com/events/commit/), GitLab’s user event, first launched in 2019 to bring together the GitLab community for hands-on tips and tricks for maturing GitLab use cases and networking with other users and experts. Since then, the event has evolved to exhibit feats of inspiration and transformation that have changed peoples’ way of interacting and collaborating. Speakers showcase the power of community and sharing DevOps best practices through strategy and technology discussions, lessons learned, behind-the-scenes looks at the development lifecycle, and more. This year, the theme for Virtual GitLab Commit will be “Innovate Together.” 

“Innovation doesn’t happen in a vacuum. True innovation results from the diversity in experiences, wisdom, and creativity of others,” said Sid Sijbrandij, co-founder and CEO of GitLab. “GitLab Commit provides a platform for all members of the software development community, no matter the stage of professional development they are in, to share with and learn from each other.”

As the open DevOps platform, GitLab supports teams to change how software is delivered. Commit amplifies these stories of transformation to empower DevOps teams to increase velocity, collaboration, and visibility. Each talk and experience submitted for  Commit will be considered for its own merits and its connection to the GitLab community and product.

* GitLab How-tos, Tips, and Tricks: See and share lessons about using and maximizing GitLab with the broader GitLab community
* Leading Transformation: How to plan, shape, and lead a DevOps transformation
* CI/CD, Automation, and Optimization: How to design, build, and optimize pipelines
