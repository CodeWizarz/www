**Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG)**

**Environmental**

GitLab is dedicated to minimizing its environmental footprint as a company without direct emissions from company owned facilities or direct energy consumption. GitLab has partnered with Watershed to conduct its first greenhouse gas inventory, which will drive the company’s climate action plan to understand its key sources of emissions, set reduction goals and educate team members on how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at home.

**Social**

The active worldwide community has been fundamental to the transparency of GitLab helping to build trust in the product as decisions, changes and the overall direction of the open source project are open for everyone to see. GitLab’s community programs, which include GitLab for education, GitLab for open source, and GitLab for startups aim to put GitLab’s most powerful features in the hands of communities that may not otherwise have the means to access them. 

**Governance**

GitLab is committed to the highest standards of legal and ethical business conduct and has long operated its business consistent with written operating principles and policies that reinforce this commitment. The organization strives to set an example by empowering the wider GitLab community to build and work with the highest levels of security through its DevSecOps platform. 

**Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging (DIB)**

DIB is fundamental to the success of GitLab and is an integral part of the company’s future**. **As such, the company strives to create a team that is representative of its users, and a work environment that is transparent and fosters a space in which everyone is welcomed. Authentic collaboration results in innovative solutions, enhanced efficiencies and allows GitLab to meet the needs of its customers.
