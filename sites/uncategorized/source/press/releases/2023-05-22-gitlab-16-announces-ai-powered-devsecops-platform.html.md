Value Stream Management allows customers to visualize end-to-end DevSecOps workstreams, manage software development processes, and gain insight into how digital transformation and technology investments are delivering value and driving business results. GitLab’s Value Stream Analytics helps organizations visualize and manage the DevSecOps workflow from ideation to delivery, and the Value Stream Dashboard features an enterprise-wide view of DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) metrics, cycle times, and other key metrics like critical vulnerabilities and deployment frequency.

The current and upcoming updates to GitLab 16 reflect the industry demand for AI integrated with DevSecOps workflows and the need for organizations to ship secure software faster, according to GitLab’s 7th annual Global DevSecOps Report, [Security Without Sacrifices](https://about.gitlab.com/developer-survey/?utm_medium=pressrelease&utm_source=globenewswire&utm_campaign=devsecopsreport). The survey found that 65% of developers are using artificial intelligence and machine learning in testing efforts or plan to in the next three years. The report also found that security, efficiency, and automation were the top benefits of a DevSecOps platform. The new functionalities released with GitLab 16 enable organizations to leverage the power of AI to deliver software efficiently, without compromising security.

“Developers are under tremendous pressure to ship software faster than ever before to keep up with the speed of the market, and too often that leaves security as an afterthought,” said Mark Portofe, Director of Platform Engineering at CARFAX. “GitLab’s DevSecOps platform proves that security and efficiency are not mutually exclusive by integrating security seamlessly throughout development workflows and enabling us to ship software faster.  With the implementation of GitLab, we’ve seen a 33% decrease in vulnerabilities in less than a year, as well as a 20% year-over-year increase in deployments.”

“AI is poised to have a transformative impact on the technology landscape broadly, and DevOps is one of the categories that will most directly benefit,” said Stephen O’Grady, Principal Analyst with RedMonk. “Platforms that leverage AI will have the opportunity not only to improve the efficiency of software development workflows but to do so while simultaneously elevating organization compliance and security standards.”

“GitLab 16 delivers the most comprehensive enterprise DevSecOps platform in the market with more AI-powered capabilities available to customers today than any other DevOps or DevSecOps platform," said David DeSanto, Chief Product Officer at GitLab. “This major milestone defines the next evolution of the AI-powered enterprise DevSecOps Platform, improving efficiency not just for developers but everyone in the organization who contributes to delivering software.
