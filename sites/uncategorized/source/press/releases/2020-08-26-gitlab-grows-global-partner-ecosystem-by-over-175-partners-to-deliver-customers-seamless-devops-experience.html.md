_Offering the right people, process and platforms to enable organizations on their digital transformations_

**SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA - August 26, 2020 —** [GitLab Commit](https://about.gitlab.com/events/commit/#schedule) —  [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), the DevOps platform delivered as a single application, today announced it has grown its global partner ecosystem by over 175 partners over the past year, adding high-value services and capabilities through technology integrations that offer complementary value around the GitLab product and joint customers’ ability to be successful through their digital transformation. Based on a [recent DevSecOps survey](https://about.gitlab.com/resources/downloads/2020-devsecops-report.pdf) conducted by GitLab of more than 3,650 DevOps professionals, it is clear that different businesses and users are at different points in their transformation and DevOps journey. Over 25% of companies are in the DevOps “sweet spot” of three to five years of practice. While another 37% have between one and three years of practice under their belts.

The GitLab Partner Program takes a holistic approach to meeting its customers wherever they are in their DevOps journey by helping them solve challenges and delivering value. During the first part of the approach, GitLab leverages its strong relationships with cloud and platform provider integrations allowing customers to take a cloud agnostic approach and deploy anywhere to meet their business needs. The second part of the approach focuses on existing customer point tools already in place that need to integrate into GitLab. These customers then have the ability to tap into GitLab’s vast integration partner ecosystem allowing them to continue on their DevOps journey with a single application. The last part of this approach includes solving for people and process changes. This is where our partners play a key role in offering their expertise and services around the cloud and platform providers and technology integrations to round out the customer’s implementation of the DevOps lifecycle.

New strategic partner relationships and technology integrations include:

*   **Technology Partners:** Cloud and platform providers as well as complementary solutions through product integrations with GitLab. These technology partners are key to expanding GitLab customer solutions and capabilities through integrations with cloud platforms, [Kubernetes](https://about.gitlab.com/resources/downloads/gitlab-partnership-roadmap.pdf), and legacy DevOps solutions.
