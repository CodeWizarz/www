**SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA - December 09, 2020** — [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), the DevOps platform delivered as a single application, announced today that it has been named a Representative Vendor in the Gartner [Market Guide](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=f83R91qjit_K3mWM-ACd4oEHvAFEvLhjptkw3eN0zOqMCM2yGnt48iKGypNlEsk81-FhbF73-Yxl5WZaOD9JLhFxxY41Yn35egmcdjFkJep-DX3XuH1HwEzfOthFsWJx7VpWUCFyC1mVK-QRIU4jew==) DevOps Value Stream Delivery Platforms, which recognizes DevOps Value Stream Delivery Platforms (VSDP) as an emerging category in the software marketplace. To us, this recognition further validates GitLab’s position as a pioneer in the emerging market of DevOps platforms.

According to Gartner, “VSDPs provide a unified platform to reduce the complexity of integrating pipeline activities across the application development value stream. This value stream comprises the sequence of activities to deliver customer value using agile and DevOps practices.”

What began as a combination of GitLab’s Source Code Management and Continuous Integration offerings has grown into a robust platform supporting every stage of the application delivery value stream. This single platform approach has allowed GitLab to quickly iterate and evolve to include new value-added features, such as continuous delivery, application release orchestration, infrastructure automation, dynamic application security testing (DAST), and fuzz testing.

“We believe the creation of this emerging category, and GitLab’s recognition as a Representative Vendor in this Gartner Market Guide, validates its position as the original complete DevOps platform,” said Sid Sijbrandij, CEO and Co-Founder of GitLab. According to Gartner, “By 2023, 40% of organizations will have switched from multiple point solutions to DevOps value stream delivery platforms to streamline application delivery, versus less than 10% in 2020." Sijbrandij continues, “We believe this is a clear signifier that our customer community, and the customers of our Representative Vendor counterparts, are ahead of the curve and positioned for success.”

As a result of the sudden transition to remote work in 2020, development teams across the globe have come to know the challenges of creating scalable, secure DevOps environments, while also trying to reduce the costs of infrastructure and operations. As one of the world’s largest, all-remote companies since its founding in 2011, GitLab was created to handle these challenges through every step of the DevOps lifecycle. Today, the company continues to build on the industry’s most comprehensive DevOps platform while working to provide the best user experience and end-to-end visibility at every stage of the DevOps lifecycle.
