### Why is this important?

Peer-based reviews provide important data points from users who have hands on experience with a specific solution. They are most beneficial when paired with market research from experts and provide a different perspective for decision makers that are looking to find the right solution for their business, in this case ARO. Peer reviews give more detail into lessons learned from end users accounting for personal experiences that are valuable to form an educated opinion when going through a buying process. Another key benefit is the ability to find and sort through reviews based on specific demographics, whether it's around a particular technology, size of an organization, industry, or geographic location.


### Key results in the publication:

Reviewers evaluated eligible vendors based on a variety of criteria used to create high level comparisons. The comparisons cover "overall vendor rating,"willingness to recommend," and "product capabilities" in one group. The other group of comparisons covers "evaluation and contracting," integration and deployment," as well as "service and support."  Here are the takeaways for these two groups:

**Overall rating, willingness to recommend, and product capabilities**

GitLab led the way in total number of responses for each of these criteria in the report published March 2020, showing that our end users have a high degree of confidence in expressing their opinions and experiences. No other vendor had greater than 94 responses for the groups below.
* Overall rating: GitLab rated a 4.6 out of 5 with 192 responses, tied for the highest overall rating among included vendors.
* Willingness to recommend: 95% of respondents said they were willing to recommend GitLab for ARO out of 192 responses.
* Product capabilities: GitLab rated 4.6 out of 5 for ARO capabilities with 190 total responses.


**Evaluation and contracting, integration and deployment, service and support**

GitLab also received the highest number of responses for this set of criteria for each group.
* Evaluation and contracting: GitLab rated a 4.5 out of 5 with 127 responses.
* Integration and deployment: Just below the highest rating of 4.7, GitLab rated a 4.6 out of 5 with 175 responses.
* Service and support: GitLab rated 4.5 out of 5 with 169 responses, again tied for the highest score among eligible vendors.

Taking into account all of the data above, we're extremely pleased to see a large number of total responses because it helps indicate a more trustworthy summary rating. Along with high ratings for each individual criteria group, this resulted in our recognition of "Customers' Choice."

### The GitLab Application Release Orchestration vision

At GitLab, we're continuing to invest in [Release Orchestration](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/release/release_orchestration/) as a core part of our overall [Release stage vision](https://youtu.be/pzGCishRoh4) in both the short term and long term. We're constantly iterating to improve existing capabilities, adding new features that help coordinate complex releases, and looking for additional ways to replace manual work with automation wherever possible. Long term, we're focused on improving overall usability, maturity and nimbleness when orchestrating releases in GitLab, with an emphasis on making release management easier across multiple projects.
