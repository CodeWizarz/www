            Since we all work remotely at GitLab, we use team video calls regularly (with more than 50 people on most days!).
            Mostly only our CEO and
            %a{href: "/company/team-pets/", :"data-ga-name" => "Suzy", :"data-ga-location" => "body"}Suzy
            are in the San Francisco boardroom.
