Today we are releasing version 11.4.7 for GitLab Community Edition and
Enterprise Edition. This release only contains a fix for GitLab Enterprise
Edition, GitLab Community Edition has no changes compared to 11.4.6.

## GitLab Enterprise Edition

Available in GitLab Starter, Premium, and Ultimate:

- [Fix code owner suggestion missing in GitLab Starter](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/merge_requests/8248)

## Upgrade barometer

This version does not include any new migrations, and should not require any
downtime.

Please be aware that by default the Omnibus packages will stop, run migrations,
and start again, no matter how “big” or “small” the upgrade is. This behavior
can be changed by adding a [`/etc/gitlab/skip-auto-migrations`](http://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/update/README.html) file,
which is only used for [updates](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/update/README.html).

## Updating

To update, check out our [update page](/update/).

## GitLab subscriptions

Access to GitLab Starter, Premium, and Ultimate features is granted by a paid [subscription](/pricing/).

Alternatively, [sign up for GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com/users/sign_in)
to use GitLab's own infrastructure.
