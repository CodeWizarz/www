Today, we are thrilled to announce the release of GitLab 14.6, the last release for 2021. This release brings [simplified Geo configuration](#seamless-worldwide-performance-with-geo) that helps globally distributed teams accelerate Git clone or Git pull commands by automatically using the geo site closest to them, an [activity list for GitLab's Agent](#gitlab-agents-activity-information) that logs real-time events such as connection and token status, and various SAST improvements including [SAST execution policies](#sast-scan-execution-policies) and support for [.NET 6](#sast-support-for-net-6).

These are just a few highlights from the 30+ improvements in this release. Read on to check out all of the great updates below.
