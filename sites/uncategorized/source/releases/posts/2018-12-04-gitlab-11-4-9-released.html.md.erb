Today we are releasing version 11.4.9 for GitLab Community Edition and Enterprise Edition.

This version resolves a number of regressions and bugs in
[last month's 11.4 release](/releases/2018/10/22/gitlab-11-4-released/) and
prior versions.

## GitLab Community Edition and Enterprise Edition

Available in GitLab Core, Starter, Premium, and Ultimate:

- [Display impersonation token value after creation](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/22916)
- [Correctly handle data-loss scenarios when encrypting columns](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/23306)

## Upgrade barometer

This version does not include any new migrations, and should not require any
downtime.

Please be aware that by default the Omnibus packages will stop, run migrations,
and start again, no matter how “big” or “small” the upgrade is. This behavior
can be changed by adding a [`/etc/gitlab/skip-auto-migrations`](http://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/update/README.html) file,
which is only used for [updates](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/update/README.html).

## Updating

To update, check out our [update page](/update/).

## GitLab subscriptions

Access to GitLab Starter, Premium, and Ultimate features is granted by a paid [subscription](/pricing/).

Alternatively, [sign up for GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com/users/sign_in)
to use GitLab's own infrastructure.
