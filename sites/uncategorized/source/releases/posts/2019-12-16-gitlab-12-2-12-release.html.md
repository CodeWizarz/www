Today we are releasing version 12.0.12, 12.1.17, and 12.2.12 for GitLab Community Edition and Enterprise Edition.

## GitLab Community Edition and Enterprise Edition

Available in GitLab Core, Starter, Premium, and Ultimate:

### Backport
[Fix infinite retries of interrupted jobs](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/sidekiq-reliable-fetch/merge_requests/14)

### Dependency Update

The Git dependency has been upgraded to 2.22.2 in order to apply security fixes
detailed
[here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/git/git/master/Documentation/RelNotes/2.22.2.txt).

[CVE-2019-19604](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-19604)
was identified by the GitLab Security Research team. For more information on
that issue, please visit the [GitLab Security Research Advisory](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/disclosures/blob/master/003_git_submodule/advisory.md)


## Upgrade barometer

This version does not include any new migrations, and should not require any
downtime.

Please be aware that by default the Omnibus packages will stop, run migrations,
and start again, no matter how “big” or “small” the upgrade is. This behavior
can be changed by adding a [`/etc/gitlab/skip-auto-reconfigure`](http://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/update/README.html) file,
which is only used for [updates](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/update/README.html).

## Updating

To update, check out our [update page](/update/).

## GitLab subscriptions

Access to GitLab Starter, Premium, and Ultimate features is granted by a paid [subscription](/pricing/).

Alternatively, [sign up for GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com/users/sign_in)
to use GitLab's own infrastructure.
