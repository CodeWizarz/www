Today we are releasing versions 10.3.4, 10.2.6, and 10.1.6 for GitLab Community Edition (CE) and Enterprise Edition (EE).

These versions contain a number of important security fixes, including two
that prevent remote code execution, and we strongly recommend that all GitLab
installations be upgraded to one of these versions immediately.

This security release blog post is the first part of two. The second blog will
be posted in approximately 30 days, and it will detail the vulnerability
findings.

Please read on for more details regarding this release.

## Upgrade Barometer

These versions include a migration to add a column to `deploy_keys` table and
a post-deploy migration to populate it. No downtime is required.

Please be aware that by default the Omnibus packages will stop, run migrations,
and start again, no matter how ‚Äúbig‚Äù or ‚Äúsmall‚Äù the upgrade is. This behavior
can be changed by adding a [`/etc/gitlab/skip-auto-migrations` file](http://doc.gitlab.com/omnibus/update/README.html).
