When we think of everything released in the year since GitLab 13.0, we could not be more proud of our community and our team. This month, we celebrate our release of GitLab 14.0 by first taking a step back.

Together, we’ve made so much progress over the last year that we want to talk about everything it took to get to [GitLab 14](/blog/2021/06/22/gitlab-14-modern-devops/).

We use semantic versioning so a point release, like 14.0, represents everything new in this month. GitLab 14 is the culmination of the past year. Even more than that, GitLab 14 represents the future of GitLab, and the future of DevOps.

With GitLab 14, teams of all sizes are moving from maintaining DIY DevOps toolchains to adopting modern DevOps. GitLab 14 is a complete DevOps platform with security embedded in its DNA, visibility and insights enabled by its single data store, and a seamless experience and extensible system, so end users and enterprises alike reap the benefits of speed and efficiency.

We’re so excited that we’ve written a post where you can [read more about GitLab 14 and our vision for modern DevOps](/blog/2021/06/22/gitlab-14-modern-devops/), and how it enables any team to build and deliver software with velocity, visibility, and trust.

As ever, we are also excited about what’s new this month in 14.0. Read on for our regular highlights from dozens of significant new features and improvements. Along with these exciting new features, there are a few [breaking changes in 14.0](/blog/2021/06/04/gitlab-moving-to-14-breaking-changes/). To preview what's coming in next month’s release, check out our [Upcoming Releases](/direction/kickoff/) page, which includes our 14.1 release kickoff video.
