GitLab's community is critical to our success and meetups are important for our community. They give our community members a chance to engage with each other, make new connections, and better educate themselves about the power of GitLab. 

Thanks to an amazing group of meetup organizers, GitLab has a network of [36 meetup groups](https://www.meetup.com/pro/gitlab) with more than 7,700 members around the world. In 2019, our organizers hosted more than 100 events. We expect the numbers of organizers, groups, meetup members, and events to grow significantly in 2020.

If you'd like to attend a GitLab Meetup, you can see our December meetups listed below. No event in your area? Our [Meetup Pro](https://www.meetup.com/pro/gitlab) page will show you if we have a group near you. No group near you? Why not try starting your own GitLab Meetup in 2020? We'll be happy to support you along your journey. Take a look at the [GitLab Meetups page](/community/meetups) or reach out to [me](https://twitter.com/john_cogs/) to learn how GitLab can help you start a meetup in your area.
