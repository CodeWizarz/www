We hear you:

We have a scary, angry looking raccoon dog logo.

We figured we could use a better representation of GitLab.

**Update May 20th:**

After careful consideration we have decided that this is our new logo:

![new GitLab Logo option A](/images/new_logo/A.jpg)

We like the way it looks in GitLab:

And compared to the old logo:

The options we didn't pick:

![new GitLab Logo option B](/images/new_logo/B.jpg)
![new GitLab Logo option C](/images/new_logo/C.jpg)
![new GitLab Logo option D](/images/new_logo/D.jpg)

If you have a better suggestion than one of the ones above, a certain preference
or opinion, we'd love to hear it.

The final choice of our new logo rests with [Dmitriy](https://twitter.com/dzaporozhets).
