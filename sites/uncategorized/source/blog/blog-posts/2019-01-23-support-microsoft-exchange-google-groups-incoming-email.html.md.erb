As of [GitLab 11.7](/releases/2019/01/22/gitlab-11-7-released/), you can now use either Microsoft Exchange or Google Groups with your self-managed GitLab instance, configured as an email server, giving you even more options when setting up incoming email functionality. Users of GitLab.com are unaffected by this change, and already have access to features requiring incoming email, per their specific [subscription](/pricing/#gitlab-com).

There are several important features in GitLab that depend on users being able to receive emails from GitLab:
- [Comment on issues and merge requests by replying to notification emails](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/reply_by_email.html)
- [Create a new issue via email with a user-specific email address](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issues/managing_issues.html#new-issue-via-email)
- [Create a new merge request via merge request with a user-specific email address](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/index.html#create-new-merge-requests-by-email)
- [Service Desk: Have your customers email in feedback/support which are converted directly into GitLab issues](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/service_desk.html)

Previously, these features were available to self-managed GitLab users only if your email server supported sub-addressing. Microsoft Exchange and Google Groups do not support sub-addressing. GitLab 11.7 now supports both sub-addressing and catch-all email mailboxes, enabling compatibility with these two popular options that do provide catch-all email mailboxes.
