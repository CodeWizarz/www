Free tier users of GitLab can now experience shorter CI/CD execution times with medium GitLab [SaaS runners on Linux](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/runners/saas/linux_saas_runner.html). Previously, [Free tier](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/) users could only use our small SaaS runner on Linux, which sometimes resulted in longer CI/CD execution times. As of now, though, our medium SaaS runners on Linux are available to all tiers.

To use the medium SaaS runners on Linux, simply add the `saas-linux-medium-amd64` tag in your project's `gitlab-ci.yml` file.
Under the hood, we spin up a fresh [GCP `n2d-standard-4`](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/general-purpose-machines#n2d_machine_types) VM for one-time use with 4 vCPUs, 16GB RAM, and 50GB storage attached.

We look forward to seeing our Free tier users increase their pipeline speeds.
