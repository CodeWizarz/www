“The creation of the Federal CTO position recognizes the importance of the public sector in the world of DevSecOps.

“This is an exciting time in DevSecOps, and the federal government is on the leading edge, helping navigate such challenging issues as software supply chain security and regulatory compliance. I am thrilled to step into this new role and to be GitLab’s voice at the table, ensuring that our software development and security technology and practices are reflected in efforts across the public sector,” Krooswyk says.

Krooswyk has actively been involved in GitLab’s growth since 2017. He has 25 years of experience in the software industry.
