Do you write tests? Or do you skip them because itâ€™s too complicated to run? Or maybe developers on your team just donâ€™t care? You should take a few minutes and set up CI so you can enforce good practices. Good news, you can test [all the things](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/all-the-things) automagically in [GitLab CI/CD](/features/continuous-integration/) with Docker and very little effort ðŸ¤˜

I recently gave a presentation at the [SagLacIO](http://saglac.io/) about [GitLab CI/CD](/features/continuous-integration/).

## Getting started

First, youâ€™ll need an account at [GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com/). If you donâ€™t already have one, you can open an account with no problem. [GitLabâ€™s free tier](/stages-devops-lifecycle/) gives you a ton of features, unlimited free hosted repositories, 2,000 CI build minutes per month, etc. You can even use your own task runners in case you bust that limit.
