We have liftoff! The 2019 Global Developer Report: DevSecOps has arrived! Thanks to the 4,071 crew members – across various industries, roles, and geographic locations – we’ve uncovered what helps and hurts software professionals on the journey to bring developers, security professionals, and operations team members together.

According to our survey respondents, the primary mission for all software professionals today is improvement.  Everyone wants more secure code, increased visibility, reduced cycle times, and continuous deployment, but how do teams get there? Based on our survey results, DevOps done right can help realize these goals. But DevOps itself can be challenging to implement, creating other difficulties.

Here are a few key takeaways from the survey that might help you create a more nuanced and strategic DevOps flight plan for your organization.

## Good DevOps: The answer to security problems?

Security teams in a longstanding DevOps environment reported they are 3 times 
more likely to discover bugs before code is merged and 90% more likely to test 
between 91% and 100% of code than teams who encounter early-stage DevOps. Nearly 
half of all mature DevOps respondents practiced continuous deployment in at least 
some part of their organizations. But at the same time, only about a third of 
respondents actually rated their organizations’ DevOps efforts as “good.”

> “The big takeaway from this survey is that early adopters of strong DevOps 
models experience greater security and find it easier to innovate, but barriers 
still prevent developers and security teams from achieving true DevSecOps,” said 
Sid Sijbrandij, CEO and co-founder of GitLab. “Teams need a single solution that 
can provide visibility into both sides of the process for streamlined deployment.”

Clearly challenges remain, and nowhere is that more obvious than in security. 
While 69% of developers indicate they’re expected to write secure code, nearly 
half of security pros surveyed (49%) said they struggle to get developers to make 
remediation of vulnerabilities a priority. And 68% of security professionals feel 
that fewer than half of developers are able to spot security vulnerabilities 
later in the lifecycle. Roughly half of security professionals said bugs were 
most often found by them after code is merged in a test environment.

## Choosing DevOps

More companies are making the move to DevOps than before, and for good reason – 
teams that have successfully implemented a mature [DevOps model](/solutions/dev-sec-ops/) experience major 
improvements in their workflow. According to the survey, developers who work at 
organizations with immature DevOps models feel their processes inhibit them, 
while those who work with mature models are almost 1.5 times more likely to feel 
innovative and 3 times more likely to discover security vulnerabilities earlier 
on in the pipeline.

Poor DevOps practices slow teams down. Those organizations are 2.5 times more 
likely to encounter significant delays during the planning stage and 2.6 times 
more likely to wade through red tape, slowing efforts to quickly fix security 
vulnerabilities.

## Remote work works

According to our survey respondents, working remotely leads to greater 
collaboration, better documentation, and transparency. In fact, developers in a 
mostly remote environment are 23% more likely to have good insight into what 
colleagues are working on and rate the maturity of their organization’s security 
practices 29% higher than those who work in a traditional office environment.

## About the survey

GitLab surveyed 4,071 software professionals across various industries, roles,
and geographic locations. The margin of error is 2%, assuming a population size
of 23 million software professionals and a 95% confidence level.

## Methodology

We launched a Global Developer Survey on Jan. 23, 2019, collecting responses
until Feb. 27, 2019. During that time, we promoted the survey primarily on GitLab’s
social media channels and newsletter.
