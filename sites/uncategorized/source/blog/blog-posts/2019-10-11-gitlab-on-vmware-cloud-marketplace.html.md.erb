Have you ever tried to choose from an extensive list of developer tools and wondered what you should do next? You’re not alone. There are hundreds of solutions to choose from, which can make it challenging to select the right solution and deploy.

Now, GitLab and Bitnami have partnered to offer VMware users [GitLab](https://marketplace.cloud.vmware.com/services/details/129dc4e9-191d-405f-ab4d-803d56f366a9) in the VMware Cloud Marketplace. This version package is free, fully functional, and easy to [upgrade to an enterprise plan](https://docs.bitnami.com/vmware-marketplace/apps/gitlab-ee/get-started/license/).

### Reduce costs and avoid security risks
As the industry leader in application packaging, Bitnami helped GitLab create an easy, click-to-deploy, open source solution. The GitLab Enterprise Edition (CORE) Virtual Appliance certified by Bitnami is an up-to-date and secure image that includes the latest versions of the application, its components, and the most recent security fixes. You can run GitLab with confidence; Bitnami’s automated pipeline and tools for building and testing applications ensure this application can run on any platform without issues. If you experience any problems deploying the solution, you can contact the [Bitnami Support team](https://community.bitnami.com/c/gitlab) with your questions.

### Run on VMware infrastructure in a few clicks
To make GitLab available in the [VMware Cloud Marketplace](https://marketplace.cloud.vmware.com/services/details/129dc4e9-191d-405f-ab4d-803d56f366a9), GitLab placed its trust in Bitnami’s expertise in packaging. GitLab users now have the ability to run the latest version on their VMware infrastructure in a few clicks.

### Some of the key benefits of GitLab's marketplace listing:
* GitLab includes a built-in container registry and Kubernetes integration, enabling you to quickly create a [continuous integration (CI)](/features/continuous-integration/) pipeline with Kubernetes. Learn more about [creating a CI/CD pipeline with GitLab and Kubernetes](https://docs.bitnami.com/tutorials/create-ci-cd-pipeline-gitlab-kubernetes/).
* By deploying GitLab on a VMware cloud server, you can add a budget- and resource-checking stage to your pipeline. This allows you to implement best practices into your continuous deployment (CD) process and control the consumption and costs of your application deployments.
* Premium features such as code quality and performance testing, static and dynamic application security testing, package dependency analysis, and automated tests for vulnerabilities enable you to identify and remediate issues and security breaches from development to monitoring stages.
