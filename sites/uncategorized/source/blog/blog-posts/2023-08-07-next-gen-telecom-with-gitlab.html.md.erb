In November 2022, the Linux Foundation Europe [announced the launch of Project Sylva](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/linux-foundation-europe-announces-project-sylva-to-create-open-source-telco-cloud-software-framework-to-complement-open-networking-momentum), a cloud-native, [open source](https://go.gitlab.com/spHNym) telecommunications software stack. The initiative represents a cross-industry collaboration between major telecommunications providers and vendors (Telefonica, Telecom Italia, Orange, Vodafone, Deutsche Telekom, Ericsson, and Nokia), who formally agreed to collaborate on building the foundation of a next-generation telecommunications system in the open.

Today that work continues [on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/sylva-projects), where the project is gaining momentum as its contributor community grows. Eager to hear what that community has achieved since last year, I sat down with [Andr√© Vieira](https://gitlab.com/andre.macedo.av), the project's communications lead. 

Watch our interview to learn more about Sylva's guiding mission and vision, its successes, its challenges, and its future.
