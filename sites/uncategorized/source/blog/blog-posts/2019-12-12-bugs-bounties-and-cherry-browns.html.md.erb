One year ago today, [we launched our public bug bounty program](/blog/2018/12/12/gitlab-hackerone-bug-bounty-program-is-public-today/), a crucial element in our strategy to secure our product and protect our company. 

### Bigger, stronger, more secure

It seems like only yesterday (ok, June 2014) that we launched our first program on HackerOne, a vulnerability disclosure initiative that would award security researchers swag in exchange for bugs. Once that program was mature enough â€“ and our security team was prepared to manage it â€“ the next natural step was a public bug bounty program which lead to a huge increase in report submissions and cash in reporters' pockets!
 
Over the past year weâ€™ve started tackling some [early lessons learned](/blog/2019/07/19/what-we-learned-by-taking-our-bug-bounty-program-public/) and evolved the way we communicate with our reporters, the way we reward bounties, and even [what weâ€™re paying for high and critical severity findings](/blog/2019/11/18/were-increasing-bounties-in-our-bug-bounty-program/). But weâ€™re not done learning yet.  We want everyone to contribute and are always keen to hear about new ways to improve our bug bounty program so let us know if you have any suggestions. 

As we look back at the past year, weâ€™re proud to report that weâ€™ve received a total of 1378 reports from 513 extremely talented security researchers from across the globe. We awarded a total of $565,650 in bounties to 171 researchers who reported valid vulnerabilities. The program kept our engineers on their toes, challenged and surprised our security team, and helped us keep GitLab more secure.

### Weâ€™re pretty excited about all this, but we know youâ€™re waiting with bated breath to hear about some even more riveting news... 

In October, we announced a [bug bounty contest](/blog/2019/09/24/reducing-time-to-payout-and-launching-a-bug-bounty-anniversary-contest/). From October 1 through November 30, we were looking for contributors to our program across the following areas: 

â€¢ Most reputation points from submissions to our program    
â€¢ Most reputations points collected by a reporter new to our program  
â€¢ Best written report  
â€¢ Most innovative report  
â€¢ Most impactful finding 

We just knew our reporters WOULD NOT DISAPPOINT.  

**We received 279 reports from 123 different individuals between October 1 and November 30, and 89 of them were from new reporters!**  

### Thank you to all who contributed. Weâ€™re beyond excited to announce these winners:
