At Arm TechCon 2019, GitLab and Arm [announced](/blog/2019/10/08/devops-on-the-edge-a-conversation-about-gitlab-and-arm/) a joint partnership with the goal of providing first class citizen support for Arm architecture starting with [GitLab’s CI/CD tool](/topics/ci-cd/).

"Arm is on a mission to make cloud-native developers’ experience frictionless by building out the software stack and enabling a complete set of developer tools," says [Pete Goldberg](/company/team/#pete_goldberg), director of Partnerships, GitLab. "Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the first major cloud provider to build and deploy Arm-powered compute instances. GitLab is proud to be Arm’s CI/CD solution, enabling DevOps to seamlessly certify new and existing applications in production environments hosted on AWS Graviton2."

### GitLab and Arm announcement and partnership enhancements

Today, the partnership achieved another major milestone in its partnership efforts with the delivery of official support for 32-bit and 64-bit Arm-based GitLab runners in binary, rpm/deb packaging, and Docker image format.

#### This milestone highlights the following enhancements:


*   Arm [Runner binaries](https://gitlab-runner-downloads.s3.amazonaws.com/latest/index.html) were made available in the 12.6 release as part of the Graviton2 launch at [AWS re:Invent 2019](/blog/2019/12/13/updates-from-aws-reinvent/), allowing developers to start immediately in their custom environments.
*   [RPM/DEB packages](https://packages.gitlab.com/runner/gitlab-runner) for easier install/upgrade in 12.9 release.
*   Native Arm [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/gitlab/gitlab-runner/tags) in 13.0 release for container-based environments.

#### As a testament to the strength of the partnership, GitLab has:

*   [Joined](https://developer.arm.com/solutions/infrastructure/developer-resources/ci-cd/gitlab) the [Arm Neoverse developer program ](https://developer.arm.com/solutions/infrastructure/developer-resources/ci-cd/gitlab)
*   Adding support for Arm architectures for [Auto DevOps](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/214552) and [Omnibus](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/issues/1625)
