If you’re like me, you probably "try" new software and different products all
the time. I’ve lost track of how many trials I’ve started, but I know that the
trial helps me make a better decision about what to do next.

The same is true with GitLab; you really should try it out to get a sense about
how much power and value is at your fingertips. What’s the difference between
using the open source version of GitLab and the enterprise features of GitLab.com Gold / GitLab Ultimate? Night and day.

Here are a few things that you should explore in a GitLab trial:
* Security ([SAST](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/sast/), [DAST](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dast/), and [dependency scans](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/dependency_scanning/))
* [Portfolio management](/solutions/agile-delivery/) and tracking epics and roadmaps
* [Licence management](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/compliance/license_compliance/index.html)
* [Kubernetes](/solutions/kubernetes/) integration and management
* [LDAP](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/auth/ldap/index.html) integration
* [Merge requests](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/) with multiple reviewers

Until now, if you wanted to explore these great GitLab features, your only option
was to [download GitLab Ultimate](/free-trial/), install it, spin up your self-managed instance,
and start your trial.

We’ve heard from customers that they wanted an easier way to try the enterprise
features of GitLab without the extra work to download, install, and configure.
Now, you can skip straight to trying GitLab with our new **GitLab Gold Trial**.
**GitLab.com Gold** is our hosted version of Gitlab Ultimate, where you can quickly
explore and test the end-to-end [DevOps lifecycle](/topics/devops/) features that make GitLab a one-stop
solution for your entire delivery process.
