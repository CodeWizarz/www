GitLab has a GPG key used to sign all Omnibus packages created within the [CI
pipelines](/blog/2019/07/12/guide-to-ci-cd-pipelines/). This key is set to expire on 2020-07-01 and will be extended to
expire on 2021-07-01.

## Why is this being done?

The package signing key is set to a yearly expiration time to limit the exposure
should the key be compromised and to comply with GitLab security practices.
Generating a new key each year is much more obtrusive than continually extending
the expiration time.

## What do I need to do?

The only action that needs to be taken is to update your copy of the package
signing key _if_ you validate the signatures on the Omnibus packages that GitLab
distributes.

The package signing key is not the key that signs the repository metadata
used by the OS package managers like `apt` or `yum`. Unless you are specifically
verifying the package signatures or have configured your package manager to verify
the package signatures, there is no action needed on your part to continue
installing Omnibus packages.

More information concerning [verification of the package signatures](https://docs.gitlab.com/omnibus/update/package_signatures#package-signatures)
can be found in the Omnibus documentation. If you just need to refresh a copy
of the public key, then you can find it on any of the GPG keyservers by
searching for support@gitlab.com or using the key ID of
`DBEF 8977 4DDB 9EB3 7D9F  C3A0 3CFC F9BA F27E AB47`. Alternatively you could
download it directly from packages.gitlab.com using the URL:

## I still have problems, what do I do?

Please open an issue in the [omnibus-gitlab issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/omnibus-gitlab/-/issues/new?issue&issuable_template=Bug).
