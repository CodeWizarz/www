As software professionals, you are the creators, builders, researchers, and
problem solvers of technology, and your opinions should be the pulse of the
industry. We passionately believe that [everyone can contribute](/company/mission/#mission),
so we created the Global Developer Survey as a way to help you influence the way
you, your team, and your managers code, test, and deploy. By voicing your
thoughts in the Developer Survey, you can shape a solution-focused approach
to industry-wide challenges. We hope that, together, we can drive industry
dialogue around the needs of todayâ€™s software professionals, sparking a movement
to remove roadblocks and focus on helping teams thrive.

We'll examine the findings from the Developer Survey and provide a summary and
analysis in the Developer Report, which will be published in May.
This comprehensive report dissects cross-functional relationships and offers insights
into successful practices, problem areas, and potential solutions. In our
[previous reports](/developer-survey/), we explored what teams need in order to
do their best work. This year, we want to uncover what software professionals
need in order to rapidly innovate. Whether you need more accurate estimates on
planning features, a decrease in development process delays, or early detection
of security vulnerabilities, we want to identify your needs. Learn more and [share on Twitter](https://twitter.com/gitlab/status/1088116356405518343).

## How the survey works

The survey takes less than 20 minutes to complete and includes
approximately 45 questions. The survey is anonymous, and the data and results
will be reviewed in aggregate. Weâ€™re covering a large range of topics this year,
including delays in the development lifecycle, planning features, and security analysis.

To ensure that the Developer Survey asks the right questions to elicit strong
findings, the UX research team collaborated on the survey, and we tested the
questions with the GitLab engineering team to gather feedback and suggestions
for improvement.

The survey is open to anyone involved in software engineering â€“ from developers
and engineers and security professionals to DevOps managers and IT executives.
If you're involved in software engineering, we'd love to hear your thoughts!
