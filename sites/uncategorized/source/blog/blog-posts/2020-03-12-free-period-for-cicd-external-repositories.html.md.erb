[CI/CD for GitHub](/solutions/github/) is a feature that lets you use any Git-based repository as a host in combination with GitLab CI/CD regardless of where your source code lives – [GitHub](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/ci_cd_for_external_repos/github_integration.html), [Bitbucket](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/ci_cd_for_external_repos/bitbucket_integration.html), or any other Git server. To introduce this feature to the large number of users with private repos hosted on GitHub.com, we made it available to users [free of charge](/blog/2019/03/21/six-more-months-ci-cd-github/) for a limited time only.

We then [extended the free period](/blog/2019/09/09/ci-cd-github-extended-again/) for an additional limited time. We’ve set the final end date for this free period for March 22, 2020.

If you wish to continue using [CI/CD for private external repositories](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/ci_cd_for_external_repos/index.html) past March 22, 2020, you will need to upgrade your plan to at least a [Silver plan](/pricing/).

Of course, you always have the option of migrating your project to [GitLab.com](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/import/github.html). As part of our commitment to our value of transparency and open source, all public repositories on GitLab.com get all of the features in our top-tier Gold plan for free. If your repo on GitHub.com is public, then it gets mirrored to GitLab.com as a public repo and you have access to CI/CD capabilities.

Note: If you are only using [repository mirroring](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/repository_mirroring.html#pulling-from-a-remote-repository) without CI/CD then you only need a Bronze plan to continue using this functionality.

So, what exactly does this mean for you?

*  The ability to mirror private external repositories and run CI/CD on them will no longer be available as of March 22, 2020, unless the repositories have been made public or you have upgraded to an eligible GitLab plan.
*  Since [GitLab Pages](/stages-devops-lifecycle/pages/) can only be published through GitLab CI, users who were using a GitHub repository with private projects and haven't upgraded to an eligible GitLab plan will be unable to have private pages.

We've designed this process to be a smooth transition for our users. If you have any additional questions about the change, or how this impacts you and your teams, please don’t hesitate to reach out:
*  For general questions or pricing inquiries, please contact our **[Sales team](/sales/)**.
*  For technical questions or concerns, please review our **[Support options](/support/)**.

Thanks!
