We're excited to announce the first round of speakers for our inaugural [GitLab Commit](/events/commit) conference in Brooklyn! This group of speakers includes thought leaders and industry experts, members of both the GitLab team and wider community, and people from diverse backgrounds with diverse perspectives. 

Brilliant minds from the likes of Delta Air Lines, Goldman Sachs, T-Mobile, DigitalOcean, VMware, and Cloud Native Computing Foundation will join GitLab CEO and co-founder Sid Sijbrandij for an unforgettable day of learning and networking.

Attendees can expect great conversations and insights on how to bring teams together to deliver code quickly and securely, and how to push innovation forward at lightning speeds. We look forward to seeing you there on **September 17th** and experiencing a unique event that is taking over Williamsburg, Brooklyn. 

### Venue and Location

GitLab Commit Brooklyn will not only take place at the [Williamsburg Hotel](https://www.thewilliamsburghotel.com/), but will be a Williamsburg neighborhood *takeover*. Every venue in a two block radius will have its own theme, immersing you in the city. From a graffiti wall to a trip to a brewery, your day of learning about the future of software development will be full of creative inspiration.

Hear talks, mix and mingle with new and old friends at the Williamsburg hotel, Wythe Hotel, Kinfolk, Schimanski’s and end the night at Brooklyn Bowl.
