StackPointCloud [partnered with us](/blog/2017/07/10/stackpoint-gitlab-integration/) to bring you an end-to-end, turn-key Kubernetes solution, speeding up the process from idea to production. Watch the turn-key piece in action in our recent webcast.

Kubernetes allows you to manage an application across different resources and clouds, enabling self-healing (so if a container dies, it will be rescheduled on another host) and scaling up on demand, or scaling down as needed to save costs. With a host of benefits, it's no surprise that there's a strong and active community around Kubernetes, but for some teams, the time and effort required to install and configure a Kubernetes cluster could be better spent elsewhere.

While GitLab covers every step of the software development lifecycle, we do require you to have a Kubernetes cluster up and running before you begin to use it, which is where some users get stuck. Watch the video below to see how our friends at [StackPoint.io](https://stackpointcloud.com/) have worked with us on a solution that does the hard work for you, to "close the last mile" in under 10 minutes. The demo starts at 12:02.
