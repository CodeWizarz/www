We've (finally) integrated [eslint-plugin-vue](https://github.com/vuejs/eslint-plugin-vue) successfully into our codebase!

<!-- more -->

When we [added Vue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/5845) to our codebase back in April 2016, [eslint-plugin-vue](https://github.com/vuejs/eslint-plugin-vue) did not yet [exist](https://github.com/vuejs/eslint-plugin-vue/commit/6a3a6db540e823b51af1e02950896ac9c2b49219) and we had not yet started using [eslint](https://eslint.org/) at all.

One of the things I love the most about GitLab being an open source tool is that anyone can contribute! [Winnie Hellmann](https://gitlab.com/winh), who has since joined the team, did this amazing work [adding eslint](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/5445) as a community contribution. Thanks Winnie! üôá‚Äç

## The start of a style guide

As our Vue codebase grew from a few features to quite a large usage ([issue boards](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/5554), [environments](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/8954), [cycle analytics](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/7366), [pipelines](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/10878)) we noticed that each of our Vue apps followed a different style. At that time we felt the need to [document how to architecture a Vue application](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/merge_requests/8866) to ensure a consistent codebase. Once we defined and documented how to use the component system and Flux architecture [with our codebase](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/fe_guide/vue.html#vue-architecture), we noticed that our Vue code also differed in very small things, such as indentation or the order we declared the methods. These inconsistencies, although small, increased the complexity of the review process and for maintaining a healthy codebase.

With the goal of decreasing the time we spent reviewing Vue code and debating on each of these aspects, and because at the time there wasn't an official Vue style guide, [we started our own](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/commit/8c3bdc853a5237a3bef6e26fcf22132db7e8bd9c)! You can check out our documentation [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/e e/development/fe_guide/style_guide_js.html#vue-js). As the Vue community grew, the need for an official style guide and for an eslint plugin for Vue grew with it. Thanks to the wonderful team [Micha≈Ç Sajn√≥g](https://github.com/michalsnik), [Toru Nagashima](https://github.com/mysticatea), [Armano](https://github.com/armano2) and [Chris Fritz](https://github.com/chrisvfritz) leading the development of such a tool, we are now able to use it in production! And we even got to act as source of [inspiration for the official one](https://github.com/vuejs/eslint-plugin-vue/issues/77#issuecomment-315834845) ‚ù§

## Adding eslint-vue-plugin

After [waiting a couple of months](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/34312) for a stable version of [eslint-plugin-vue](https://github.com/vuejs/eslint-plugin-vue), we finally gave it a try once version [4.0.0](https://github.com/vuejs/eslint-plugin-vue/releases/tag/v4.0.0) was released.

It took a couple of days to fix all the problems eslint identified in our code, but we were able to successfully add it and thanks to a huge team effort, the second row of conflicts was solved very quickly. Thanks again Luke, Eric, Kushal and Jos√©!

Now our review process is even faster, we don't have to manually check for the style guide rules anymore! üéâ
