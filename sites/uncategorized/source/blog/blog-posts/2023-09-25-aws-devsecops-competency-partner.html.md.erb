## GitLab's strength in DevSecOps
GitLab's [AI-powered DevSecOps platform](https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-duo/) helps organizations shift left on vulnerability remediation. At GitLab, shifting left means ensuring developers have a frictionless security defect remediation experience that enables them to immediately handle vulnerabilities in their code.

GitLab's DevSecOps Platform:
- surfaces security findings shortly after they are introduced and while the code is still being worked on
- associates findings directly with those who changed the code
- offers remediation guidance (including on-demand training and automated fixes)
- supports rich, in-context collaboration for vulnerability management
