It is possible to use GitLab as a best-in-class GitOps tool, and this blog post series is going to show you how. [GitOps](/topics/gitops/) is an operational framework that takes [DevOps}(https://about.gitlab.com/topics/devops/) best practices used for application development such as version control, collaboration, compliance, and CI/CD tooling, and applies them to infrastructure automation. This series of easy-to-follow tutorials will focus on different user problems, including provisioning, managing a base infrastructure, and deploying various third-party or custom applications on top of them, that can be solved by pairing GitOps with GitLab.

Here are 8 tutorials on how to do GitOps with GitLab:

**1. [Here's how to do GitOps with GitLab](/blog/2021/10/21/gitops-with-gitlab/)**

This tutorial sets the stage for what you will learn throughout the series, including the tech concepts you'll need to know.

**2. [Infrastructure provisioning with GitLab and Terraform](/blog/2021/11/04/gitops-with-gitlab-infrastructure-provisioning/)**

This tutorial walks you through setting up the underlying infrastructure using GitLab and Terraform.

**3. [Connect with a Kubernetes cluster](/blog/2021/11/18/gitops-with-gitlab-connecting-the-cluster/)**

This tutorial introduces you to CI/CD tunnels and shows step-by-step how to access a Kubernetes cluster using GitLab CI/CD.

**6. [Connecting GitLab with a Kubernetes cluster - Auto DevOps](/blog/2022/02/08/gitops-with-gitlab-auto-devops/)**

This tutorial looks at how you can use Auto DevOps with all its bells and whistles to easily manage deployments.

**7. [Connecting GitLab with a Kubernetes cluster for GitOps-style application delivery](/blog/2022/03/21/gitops-with-gitlab/)**

This tutorial shows you how to connect an application project to a manifest project for controlled, GitOps-style deployments.

**8. [Turn a GitLab agent for Kubernetes installation to manage itself](/blog/2022/03/30/gitops-with-gitlab-manage-the-agent/)**
