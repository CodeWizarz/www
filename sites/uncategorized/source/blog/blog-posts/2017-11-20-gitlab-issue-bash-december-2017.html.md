This December we'll be holding another of our quarterly issue bashes to allow the community to get involved in helping to squash some issues in the GitLab Community Edition issue tracker. We have over 1,800
[GitLab contributors](http://contributors.gitlab.com/contributors/),
and we are always looking for more people to join in and contribute to the project in any way that they can.

<!-- more -->

Of course, some lucky contributors will be rewarded with awesome swag! ðŸ™Œ

We now have [the issue bash landing page](/community/issue-bash/) with all the information about how exactly the Issue Bash works. Please take a look there and provide any feedback to our [feedback project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/issue-bash/feedback) or propose changes directly [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/www-gitlab-com/blob/master/source/community/issue-bash/index.html.haml)!

## When is it going to happen?

We'll kick it off at 00:01 UTC on Saturday, **December 16th**
and will keep it up until 23:59 UTC on Sunday, **December 17th**.

prize winners, drawn at random, will be contacted in the weeks that follow.
