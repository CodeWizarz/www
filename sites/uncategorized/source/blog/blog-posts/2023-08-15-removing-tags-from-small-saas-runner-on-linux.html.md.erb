In GitLab 17.0, we are updating the tags of our [small SaaS runner on Linux](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/runners/saas/linux_saas_runner.html) to be consistent with our other Linux runners.

## Who will be affected?
If you are using the small SaaS runner on Linux with any tag other than `saas-linux-small-amd64`, you will be affected as all other tags such as `docker` or `linux` will be deprecated. Job configurations that use a deprecated tag will become stuck.

An example job configuration that will be stuck could look like this:

```yaml
test-invalid-tag:
  stage: test
  tags:
  - docker
  - linux
  script:
    - echo "I'm affected and will be stuck after 17.0"
```

The small SaaS runner on Linux is configured to run untagged jobs; this remains unchanged.
So, if you're using the small Linux runner but haven't specified a tag, the behavior of your job will not change.

## How to avoid jobs getting stuck

To avoid jobs getting stuck after the 17.0 release, you should change the tag in your `.gitlab-ci.yaml` file to `saas-linux-small-amd64`.

An example job configuration that will work:

```yaml
test-correct-tag:
  stage: test
  tags:
  - saas-linux-small-amd64
  script:
    - echo "I'm running as expected"
```

Another example that will work is to define no tag, so the runner will pick up an untagged job:

```yaml
test-untagged:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "I'm running as expected"
```
