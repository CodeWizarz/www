Itâ€™s that time of the year to indulge in all things innovative and new at Google Cloud Next 2019.
As an attendee last year, I was excited to learn about Googleâ€™s vision on â€˜bringing the cloud to youâ€™
with a focus on hybrid cloud and unveiling of GKE On-Prem. GitLabâ€™s partnership with Google
has grown a lot since we launched our quick and easy [integration with GKE](/partners/technology-partners/google-cloud-platform/)
last year and we hope you will come out to see some of the new things we have going on.

### Don't be shy, come say hi ðŸ‘‹

Come visit us at our booth (#S1607), get scanned, and GitLab will donate $5 to your
charity of choice: [Rail Girls](http://railsgirls.com/) or [Django Girls](https://djangogirls.org/).
This also enters you for a chance to win an iPad Pro!

While you're there, we would love to showcase and talk about:

* GitLabâ€™s [AutoDevOps](/stages-devops-lifecycle/auto-devops/) functionality.
* Using GitLab to [secure your applications](/stages-devops-lifecycle/secure/).
* How to get started with [GitLab for GCP on GKE](/partners/technology-partners/google-cloud-platform/) and GKE On-Prem.
* GitLab [Serverless with Knative](/topics/serverless/) and [Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/serverless/announcing-cloud-run-the-newest-member-of-our-serverless-compute-stack),
* ... and much more!

### Sit back, relax, and listen to some of our experts live

* Check out [Brandon Jung](/company/team/#brandoncjung) (VP of Alliances) discuss [GitLabâ€™s move from Azure to GCP](https://cloud.withgoogle.com/next/sf/sessions?session=ARC207) which includes a technical
overview of the migration as well as lessons learned. Check out our customer case study [here](https://cloud.google.com/customers/gitlab/).

* Come listen to [Kathy Wang](/company/team/#wangkathy) (Senior Director of Security) tell our journey [Towards Zero Trust at GitLab.com](https://cloud.withgoogle.com/next/sf/sessions?session=SEC220) along with key lessons learned. ([You can read more about the evolution of Zero Trust here](/blog/2019/04/01/evolution-of-zero-trust/).)

* Learn something new with [Daniel Gruesso](/company/team/#danielgruesso) (Product Manager) showcasing GitLabâ€™s serverless functionality to [Run a consistent serverless platform anywhere with Kubernetes and Knative](https://cloud.withgoogle.com/next/sf/sessions?session=HYB218).

### Get hands on with Qwiklabs

Learn from [Dan Gordon](/company/team/#dbgordon) (Senior Technical Marketing Manager) at our [Spotlight Lab: Introduction to GitLab on GKE](https://cloud.withgoogle.com/next/sf/sessions?session=301353-133371). Here you will have the chance to deploy GitLab on GKE, migrate a GitHub repository into a GitLab Project, and set up a CI/CD pipeline with AutoDevOps to deploy your code to GKE.

So stop by and say hello!

We are proud to be a sponsor at this event and would love to see as many of you at our booth (S1607) to discuss GitLab [Serverless](/topics/serverless/) with Knative and Cloud Run, GitLabâ€™s integration with GKE, GitLab AutoDevOps for CI/CD, Security functionalities, as well as GitLabâ€™s support for GKE On-Prem.
