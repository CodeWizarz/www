With 2022 coming to a close, we wanted to ensure everyone gets one more chance to explore our top 10 technical blog posts of the year. Roll up your sleeves and enjoy our most-viewed how-to articles and don’t forget to bookmark them for next year!

## 1. Failed pipeline? 

We have *all* been there, and not much is more frustrating than that red X. Staff Developer Evangelist [Brendan O’Leary](/company/team/#brendan) offers his best advice on troubleshooting the “why?” of a GitLab failed pipeline – it starts with keeping the right perspective. So many factors are involved in code development that it’s critical to ask all of the questions: Is it the code? Is it the test? Is it a vulnerability, etc.?

## 2. Why Git Rebase is your BFF

With code review increasingly important to successful DevOps, Senior Backend Engineer (Gitaly) [Christian Couder](/company/team/#chriscool) thinks devs might be forgetting a secret weapon in their IDE: Git Rebase. Learn how to rework commits with Git Rebase, including expert tips to try different instructions like ‘reword’, ‘edit’, and ‘squash’.

## 3. Alert fatigue is real

Follow along with Senior Site Reliability Engineer [Steve Azzopardi](/company/team/#steveazz) as he lays out a GitLab investigation into annoying, time-consuming (and customer-facing) 502 errors in the GitLab Pages logs. To uncover the problem, Azzopardi and team had to unearth some red herrings along the way, but ultimately discovered the importance of PID 1 in a container.

## 4. More pipelines = less complexity

CI/CD is at the heart of most modern DevOps practices, but that doesn’t mean it’s a “set it and forget it.” Staff Backend Engineer Fabio Pittino acknowledges the complexity challenges of CI/CD and suggests the solution is choosing the right pipelines for the job. Understand the differences between parent-child and multi-project pipelines to streamline your CI/CD efforts.

## 5. Hacking and bug bounties

How did a Swedish web developer go from zero to number seven on our HackerOne Top 10 list in just over a year? Johan Carlsson offers a detailed look at how and why he started looking for bugs in GitLab in his spare time, and how others can jump into hacking, too.

## 6. Gitlab… on an iPad

Yes, you can code on an M1-chip-based iPad, and Staff Developer Evangelist Brendan O’Leary walks through all the necessary steps to get GitLab running using GitPod.

## 7. Speed up database changes

Many DevOps teams have mastered speedy application code changes but have struggled to make database updates equally streamlined. In this step-by-step guide, you’ll learn how to apply DevOps principles to database change management.

## 8. A primer on IaC security

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is an increasingly popular solution for DevOps teams, and with good reason: It’s an efficient and low-resource solution. But, as Senior Developer Evangelist [Michael Friedrich](/company/team/#dnsmichi) explains, it’s also ripe with potential security vulnerabilities. Friedrich takes an exhaustive look at the threats, tools, integrations, and strategies that make IaC a safer choice.

## 9. Everything you need to know about GitOps 

Want to know how to make GitLab work with GitOps? Senior Product Manager (Configure) [Viktor Nagy](/company/team/#nagyv-gitlab) created an eight-part tutorial covering everything GitLab and GitOps, culminating in how to make a GitLab agent for Kubernetes self-managing.

## 10. The skinny on static site generators

Devs will get the most out of GitLab Pages by choosing the right static site generator (SSG). Developer Evangelist [Fatima Sarah Khalid](/company/team/#sugaroverflow) reviews six options and has also created a toolkit to help make the SSG evaluation process easier.
