[OpenCores](https://opencores.org), the largest and most popular Gateware
development community with over [300K members and 1200+
projects](https://opencores.org/about/statistics), is moving to GitLab. This
is excellent news all around: as a catalyst for accelerating IP core development
and for introducing GitLab to innovative uses in the scientific and electronic
design communities.

## Gateware and OpenCores

![Gateware design flow diagram](/images/blogimages/welcoming-opencores-to-gitlab/gateware_flow.png "Gateware flow")

OpenCores is a repository of reusable units of logic, open to use as building
blocks for the electronics design community. These units are most commonly known as
[Intellectual Property (IP)
cores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor_intellectual_property_core),
and are described (coded), in [Hardware Description
Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_description_language) (HDL)
for the most part.

### What is gateware?

In the semiconductor industry, these are the basic constituents of advanced
digital designs, collectively known as
**gateware**: A layer in the electronics development chain positioned in
between _hardware_ (such as a Printed Circuit Board – PCB – or a packaged chip),
and _firmware_ (a set of decoded and executed instructions for a microprocessor).

### What is OpenCores?

The [OpenCores portal](https://opencores.org) hosts the source code for a
multitude of digital gateware projects. In its more than 20 years of web history, it has
evolved into a platform that enables its user community to discover, showcase,
and manage such projects, including revision control for [source code](/stages-devops-lifecycle/source-code-management/).

The target devices for gateware have historically been
[FPGA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-programmable_gate_array) (Field
Programmable Gate Arrays) and
[ASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit)s
(Application Specific Integrated Circuits), which allow building a vast range
of hardware digital electronics appliances. These are often described as
[SoC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip) (System on a Chip).

In recent years, the OpenCores portal has been particularly focused on hosting FPGA
applications, with the intention to enlarge the pool of available cores based
on emerging hardware description methods, such as
[HLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_synthesis) (High-level
synthesis).

OpenCores is also the place where digital designers meet to showcase, promote,
and talk about their passion and work. They do this through forums, news feeds,
and much more!

### Who maintains the OpenCores portal?

[Oliscience](http://oliscience.nl/) (open logic interconnects science) act as
the stewards of the OpenCores community and its portal. Oliscience is an
initiative originated from the
[CERN](/customers/cern/)-Nikhef Business Incubation
Centre (CERN-BIC@Nikhef), and is [supported](https://opencores.org/partners) by
[Nikhef](https://www.nikhef.nl/en/), the Dutch National Institute for Subatomic
Physics, and [ASTRON](https://www.astron.nl/), the Netherlands Institute for
Radio Astronomy.

As part of the stewardship charter, Oliscience is committed to maintaining and
supporting the OpenCores portal. This mission involves globally promoting its
community, fostering the use of open standards and practices, actively
developing the portal infrastructure and content, and more.
The [Wishbone bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wishbone_(computer_bus)),
used throughout OpenCores designs, is one of the most well-known examples.

## Leading change and embracing the DevOps culture for Gateware development

[Moore's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law) is slowing down, and
the semiconductor industry is starting to experience a new resurgence. With a
wave of new opportunities arising, FPGA is one of the key technologies that
play a crucial role in the future of computing architectures.

The barrier to entry for becoming a gateway developer is fairly higher than learning a new programming language as a software developer. As
such, the digital electronics industry is continually striving to simplify
the approach to programmable logic.

Open Source IP Cores play a significant role in this goal. They unlock a
vast knowledge pool that enables new gateware developers to start hacking on
new projects straight away. They can use existing solutions to draw knowledge
very quickly.

IP Cores strive for quality, and quality calls for a structured way to assess
the content of a code bundle. This is where Continuous Verification (CV) comes into
play.

In the context of programmable logic, CV is a
workflow in which Gateware defined in a [HDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_description_language)
runs against standardized testbenches and benchmarked to assess and rank its
quality. Full coverage for test cases and failure corner cases is guaranteed.

## Accelerating digital design with GitLab

The OpenCores community leaders have strong ties to [CERN](https://home.cern/)
and the [European Space Agency](https://www.esa.int/). Both are leading
research organizations committed to supporting their respective scientific
communities, which use GitLab for internal development.

Both organizations and the electronics industry in general are particularly
interested in a better assessment of the quality of gateware products, as their
usage in industrial and commercial applications continues to increase at an
accelerated rate. When you launch a satellite into space, you can't just press
the reset button if there is a bug!

While talking to those teams, and hearing the preliminary exploration of
implementing CV practices into gateware design, [GitLab's integral CI/CD
features](/features/continuous-integration/) seemed a natural fit to pioneer the adoption of a DevOps approach to
digital design.

Source control was also a feature that would enable engineers to share and
collaborate on their code in the public space. In summary, the benefits of a
single application for the entire DevOps cycle, with the ultimate goal of
reducing the gateware design cycle time made the decision easy.

The next objective for the OpenCores team is to implement a CV process in the
OpenCores portal, starting with FPGA and until ASICs. It's an ambitious one,
which requires ambitious partners.

Andrea Borga, Oliscience CEO mentions:
> we have a very strong scientific background, and we love to make experiments…
> all the time! Exploring new ideas, and striving for impeccable execution are
> embedded in our engineering way of thinking. You need innovative and
> ambitious partners to achieve equally innovative and ambitious goals. This
> is why we do what we do, and why we firmly believe GitLab's vision and spirit
> strongly align with our own. This is how we chose to go with them.

GitLab is thrilled to start working with the OpenCores team, to contribute to
that goal and welcoming them to a community that leading Open Source projects
such as Drupal, GNOME, KDE, Debian, Freedesktop and many more are already a
part of.
