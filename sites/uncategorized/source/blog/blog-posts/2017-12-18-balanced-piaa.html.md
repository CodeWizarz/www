We recently [switched from a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) to a Developer's Certificate of
Origin (DCO)](/blog/2017/11/01/gitlab-switches-to-dco-license/)
to make it easier for everyone to contribute to GitLab. Now, we're taking our commitment to
our core tenet, "everyone can contribute," a step further. We're amending our Proprietary
Information and Assignment Agreement (PIAA) and putting clarifying processes in
place to help our contributors maintain their ability to work on projects that
are unrelated to GitLab's business, including other open source projects.

GitHub [announced the Balanced Employee Intellectual Property Agreement](https://github.com/blog/2337-work-life-balance-in-employee-intellectual-property-agreements)
(BEIPA), an open source intellectual property (IP) agreement which seeks to take
a more balanced approach to assigning control over IP. We want to
thank GitHub for taking the lead on a very important conversation. Their new
approach inspired us to take a closer look at our own PIAA, make improvements to better clarify our
position, and encourage our contributors to work on projects outside of GitLab if they want to.

We [recently launched a Twitter poll](https://twitter.com/gitlab/status/938921270913019904)
to assess the potential risk IP agreements pose to developers in our community.
We found that the majority of developers (85 percent) have a side project and nearly half
(44 percent) have worried about the IP ownership of that project. Forty-four percent
say they have used company resources for a side project, potentially putting them
at risk of violating their workplace IP agreement.

At GitLab, we want to give our contributors confidence that their developments
will *not* be owned by GitLab simply by virtue of their use of GitLab-issued computers,
GitLab facilities, or the GitLab source code repository. Furthermore, we want to
alleviate stress of not knowing whether they are in violation, given that there
is necessarily some ambiguity about which projects relate to or don't relate to
our business. So, we are making some changes.

One of [our values is boring solutions](/handbook/values/#efficiency).
With this in mind we looked at either adopting the BEIPA outright or contributing
to the document. After considerable thought we concluded that it wasn’t possible
to make either of these approaches work. Accordingly, we focused on improving our
existing PIAA.

## Why the change?

The industry standard for intellectual property agreements tend to assign a broad
swath of IP to the employer, making it difficult for a contributor to work on
outside projects without being in violation of the agreement. The most important
piece of any employee agreement is the definition of what IP is assigned from the
employee to the company.

The industry standard is to define the scope of the IP definition in three buckets:

1. IP that relates to the current or prospective business of the company
2. IP created by the employee as part of its work for the company
3. IP created using materials, facilities, funding, or confidential information of the company

We want to alleviate the unnecessary risks posed to contributors posed by buckets 1 and 3 above.

## What's changing

As a result of our internal review, we are making three important changes to our PIAA
and processes related to outside creations developed by our contributors:

1. We have entirely eliminated the section in our PIAA that would grant GitLab ownership
in developments simply by virtue of the use of GitLab equipment, including
GitLab-issued computers, GitLab facilities, or GitLab.com as a software
development platform.

2. In the event there is concern on our contributor’s behalf that there may be a gray
area, we have created a process whereby GitLab can confirm that the development is
outside the scope of GitLab’s business.

3. We have [added plain language text to our publicly viewable Handbook](/handbook/people-group/contracts-probation-periods/#approval-for-outside-projects) that clarifies
when contributors should seek further assurances from GitLab and when
they shouldn’t.  

Our goal is to give contributors a way to gain confidence in their ability to pursue
independent projects ahead of time, and reduce the risk of potential conflicts down the line.
