It’s 2022, time to learn something new. So how about studying a new programming language? Keeping your [dev skills sharpened](/blog/2021/11/17/the-top-skills-you-need-to-get-your-devops-dream-job/) and gaining fluency in more than one language is ideal for DevOps pros, according to DevOps Institute’s [2021 Upskilling Report](https://info.devopsinstitute.com/2021-upskilling-report-download).

But with all the new programming languages around, it can be tricky to know where to begin. [Stack Overflow’s 2021 Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021) found devs were most interested in learning Python, JavaScript, and Go. JavaScript is a fairly ubiquitous language, so let’s look instead at tutorials and advice for some up-and-coming languages, including Python, Go, Rust, Groovy, and Kotlin.

## The promise of Python

Python is a very popular second or third language for websites, analytics, and all things DevOps. It’s also very easy to [start learning](/blog/2021/10/21/beginner-guide-python-programming/). Python.org offers [a free tutorial](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/). There is also an [interactive option](https://www.learnpython.org).

## Go for the gold

Another language to consider is Go because its proponents say it’s incredibly easy to learn and use. Go is so interesting that GitLab Staff Developer Evangelist [Brendan O’Leary](/company/team/#brendan) is going to learn it this year [and plans to share the journey on his blog](https://boleary.dev/blog/2022-01-10-new-year-new-language.html). Learn the [basics of Go](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/getting-started) and then consider diving into [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com).

Once you’re done hitting the books, tackle a real-world challenge, like [using Go for CI](/blog/2017/11/27/go-tools-and-gitlab-how-to-do-continuous-integration-like-a-boss/).

## All about Rust

It’s safe to say the devs who know and use Rust _love_ Rust. But, to be fair, it’s not necessarily the easiest language to learn. That said, if the goal is secure code, [Rust is a solid choice](/blog/2020/07/21/rust-programming-language/). To try Rust on for size, devs can either [read The Rust Programming Language book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) or try [the Rustlings course](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/). Overachievers might want to [learn how to fuzz Rust code](/blog/2020/12/03/how-to-fuzz-rust-code/). 

## Feeling Groovy

Groovy is all about scripting and, as such, is ideal for those wanting to learn automation. Also, Groovy works side-by-side with Java, meaning it’s going to be a language that comes easily to those devs. [Get started with Groovy](https://www.guru99.com/groovy-tutorial.html). For a deeper dive, here’s [a list of books about Groovy](https://groovy-lang.org/learn.html).

## Create with Kotlin

Apparently Kotlin is a programming language that [makes developers happier](https://kotlinlang.org) and is ideal for data science projects and Android apps. If you want to be a happier developer, too, [here’s how to get started with Kotlin](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-kotlin/modules/learn-kotlin-introduction-to-kotlin). Google also offers a [bootcamp for Kotlin developers](https://www.udacity.com/course/kotlin-bootcamp-for-programmers--ud9011).

## Bonus round: Use Python and Rust together

Because there is no point in learning a new programming language unless you can use it, here’s a step-by-step guide to bringing your application idea to production [using Python, Rust, and GitLab CI](/blog/2019/11/15/python-rust-and-gitlab-ci/).
