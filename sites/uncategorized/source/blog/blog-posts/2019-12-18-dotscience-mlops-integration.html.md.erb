Today, I am proud to announce our new partnership with GitLab and [Dotscience](https://dotscience.com). GitLab and Dotscience are passionate about bringing [DevOps tools](/topics/devops/) and processes to the AI/ML ecosystem with the goal of achieving MLOps. The combination of GitLab and Dotscience provides a fully integrated DevOps & MLOps platform by combining source repository, issue tracking, and continuous integration. Together we can offer a machine learning environment that provides the ability to build, train, deploy, monitor, reproduce data, code, and models, and collaborate on notebooks.

## Dotscience and GitLab integration

The integration highlights include the following:

* Combine Dotscience and GitLab to achieve a complete DevOps & MLOps platform
* Apply the same merge request workflow you know and love in GitLab to AI & ML projects with [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) Notebooks, data, parameters & metrics with Dotscience
* Customize the Docker images you build in Dotscience by implementing the Docker build step of deploying an ML model to production as a GitLab repo, custom Dockerfile + build pipeline

## Letâ€™s see it in action

[Luke Marsden](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/luke-marsden-71b3789) and I sat down with [Tina Sturgis](/company/team/#TinaS), manager of partner marketing at GitLab, and provided a little overview of the integration.

Ready to give it a spin? The easiest way to get started is to sign up for a free trial at Dotscience and read the integration [documentation](https://dotscience.com/partners/gitlab/).

Dotscience is also available on-prem, on AWS, Azure and Google Cloud, and in multi-cloud configurations.
