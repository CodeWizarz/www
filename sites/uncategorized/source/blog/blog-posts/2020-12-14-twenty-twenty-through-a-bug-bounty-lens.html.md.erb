What a long, strange trip 2020 has been. It started with hitting the [million dollar bounties paid milestone](/blog/2020/01/14/celebrating-one-million-bug-bounties-paid/) in our [HackerOne program](https://hackerone.com/gitlab), appearing at #6 on [HackerOne‚Äôs 2020 Top Ten Public Bug Bounties program list](https://www.hackerone.com/resources/e-book/top-10-bounty-programs-2020) (up from our #10 spot from [2019](https://www.hackerone.com/resources/responsible-disclosure-program/top-20-public-bug-bounty-programs)) and having our approach to security and bug bounty program featured in this HackerOne [customer story](https://www.hackerone.com/resources/gitlab/gitlabs-approach-to-security). And then, <record scratch>  like many across the globe, our year both screeched to a halt and raged on, as we all moved forward the best that we possibly could throughout a tumultuous year with a ton of eye-opening and unbelievable global happenings spanning the realm of those we‚Äôd soon forget, to those we can and should learn and grow from.

One thing remained a constant though: The awesomely talented security researchers who submit to our program kept finding small bugs and big bugs, and our teams kept on triaging, testing, and fixing them.

We‚Äôre ending 2020 with a look back at our bug bounty program and the people who have made it a success by making our product and company more secure: our bug bounty researchers!

## 2020 by the numbers

**This year we:**
* Received a total of 1,070 reports from 505 security researchers
* Awarded a total of $380,800 USD in bounties to 62 different researchers reporting valid vulnerabilities
* Resolved 259 reports and made 131 of those reports public.
* Had 163 security researchers submit multiple reports, meaning their first engagement with us was a positive one.

**Note:** Data pulled is accurate as of Dec. 7, 2020.

*Shout out to our Bug Bounty Program manager, [James Ritchey](/company/team/#jritchey) for providing these program stats.* üì£

## Bug bounty program updates

We also rolled out a few new programs and initiatives to recognize and benefit contributors to our program.

**This year, we:**
* Reduced the time to bounty in our program from 90 days to 45 days max. We intend to continue iterating on this so that we can shorten this time frame further.
* Started a new researcher-focused blog series, called (creatively), Ask a Hacker. See our first [blog feature](/blog/2020/11/10/rpadovani-ask-a-hacker/) with [@rpadovani](https://hackerone.com/rpadovani?type=user). You can [check him out on GitLab too](https://gitlab.com/rpadovani).
* Kicked off a new Ask Me Anything (AMA) series with some of our top bug bounty hunters. You can see our first [AMA with Riccardo Padovani here](https://youtu.be/SK_vuZCafZ4).
* Began reporting our monthly program metrics and give shout-outs to the months‚Äô high earners or critical bug contributors! See [the metrics we reported out last month](https://twitter.com/gitlab/status/1330892872808271873).

Together, we are stronger üí™.

Now, onto the really good stuff. We‚Äôre excited to announce the winners of our hacking contest, which commemorates our [second year as a public bug bounty program](/blog/2018/12/12/gitlab-hackerone-bug-bounty-program-is-public-today/). üéâ ü•Å üêõ

We announced a [bug bounty contest](/blog/2020/09/28/top-tips-for-better-bug-bounty-reports-and-a-hacker-contest/#celebrating-great-reports-and-great-reporters) in October and received 138 reports from 87 different individuals between October 1 and November 30, and 55 of them were from new reporters!

Thanks to all who contributed! üôå

We know though, that 2020 has not been all cherry-plated switches. It's been a trying year for all of us, with plenty of graphs trending in all the wrong ways. There have been highlights though and this program has been a continued source of fresh, expert perspectives, aha moments and positive energy from the sheer skill and innovation the security researchers bring to our program. We‚Äôre grateful to have your continued contributions and partnership in making our product and company more secure. Here‚Äôs to a better 2021, together.

Happy hacking,

The GitLab Security team
