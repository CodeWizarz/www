It's that time again! Every nine months, our entire remote workforce descends on one location for the [GitLab Summit](/events/summit-las-vegas/). This year, we'll be in Crete, and you're invited!

<!-- more -->

Before you go off and buy a plane ticket, we should clarify that there probably isn't room for all of you on the island. But we're trying something new this Summit â€” we're live streaming every day to bring the experience to as many of our remote friends as possible.

## Watch

We'll be streaming on [YouTube](https://rebrand.ly/gitlab-summit-stream). You can watch [Sid](/company/team/#sytses) and [Dmitriy](/company/team/#dzaporozhets)'s keynotes, our Santorini trip, [GitLab team-member-led user generated content (UGC) sessions](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf9PSEMkxdlYQnAmDcXvsqeeXe-O1kRECZopG9nmwfn_O5qgA/viewform), the 10.1 release, and our final party can all be viewed in one place.
