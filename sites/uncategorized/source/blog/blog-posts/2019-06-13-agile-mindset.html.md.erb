Ensuring [Agile](/solutions/agile-delivery/) teams use the most [effective strategies](/solutions/agile-delivery/) to reduce cycle time is a
priority for IT leaders, but what good is a menagerie of techniques if a team’s
approach to software development doesn’t spark innovation? When it comes to
building the foundation for accelerating delivery, IT leaders have been incorrectly
placing emphasis on collecting tools rather than developing an Agile mindset.

> “The core of Agile is recognizing that we need to get to and maintain an Agile mindset. **If I have an organization with an Agile mindset, and really rock-solid product management, Agile processes and tools will evolve out of that. If you have the Agile mindset and an awesome connection with your customers and are solving their problems, things will evolve in the right way.** You won’t even realize you’re being Agile. It’s just good business.” — [Todd Little](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2016/06/07/the-key-missing-ingredient-in-the-agile-manifesto-mindset/#4fa5917467ff), CEO Lean Kanban

There are many definitions of an Agile mindset, but the general consensus is that it:

* Views setbacks as learning opportunities
* Embraces iteration, collaboration, and change
* Focuses on delivering value

## Agile mindset characteristics

There’s no definitive list of what makes up an Agile mindset, but with the
intention of getting you started, here are a few of the most widely accepted
characteristics. Based on your team’s dynamics, your organization’s culture, and
your goals, you may adopt other attributes to help your team accelerate delivery.

### Setbacks are learning opportunities

Empower your team to experiment and be creative so that rather than view a setback
as a failure, they’ll see it as an opportunity to learn and grow. When your team
has the freedom to be innovative – without fear – they’re more likely to solve
problems and add to the knowledge base of what works and what doesn’t.
Taking risks shouldn’t be a rebellious endeavor — it should be your team’s norm.

### Agile values and principles: Iteration, collaboration, and change

**Iteration**: Instill the belief that there’s always room for improvement and
that anyone can propose a change or idea. At GitLab, we believe
[everyone can contribute](/company/mission/#mission) and that [iteration is the fastest
way to feedback](/handbook/values/#iteration), helping us course correct and
create new features.

**Collaboration**: Finding ways to improve and increase cross-collaboration
enables frictionless handoffs, helps relieve the burden on teams, and facilitates
a culture of trust and communication. Whether you develop new workflows or use
different tools, keep an eye out for silos which can work against collaboration.

**Change**: Agile methodology is founded on the ability to adapt to
unpredictability. If your customers or organization want to pivot soon after a
direction is set, your team should be able to do just that. Any
processes or roadblocks that prevent your team’s ability to be flexible and
embrace change should be removed.

### Deliver value

We can all agree that teams should deliver value both to customers and the
organization. But where an Agile mindset makes all the difference is shifting the
emphasis from the output, which focuses only on the items delivered, to the
outcome, which is how a feature meets a market need. An Agile mindset helps teams
creatively think of how a feature can solve a problem rather than feel pressured
to deliver a set number of items in a month. It’s the whole “quality over quantity” idea.

## Steps to shift to an Agile mindset

Changing your team’s perspective and the way they approach problems is a difficult
undertaking. You’re challenging their long-held beliefs while requiring them to
complete tasks and meet deadlines. This is an uncomfortable process in any
environment, but especially in the workplace where an (in)ability to quickly
shift can impact performance and reputation. Fortunately, there are a few
methods to help you navigate these difficulties and enable your team to smoothly
adopt an Agile mindset:


1. **Model behavior**: The most effective way to help your team shift to an Agile
mindset is to exemplify the behaviors you want to see. To create a
“no-fault, embrace risk” environment, share your setbacks with the team and tell
them what you learned. When someone experiments, praise them for trying something
new and discuss the biggest lessons learned. By being transparent and showing your
team that this new way of thinking is possible, you become their collaborator.
1. **Storytelling**: Share how other organizations or teams have benefited from
an Agile mindset. Understanding what others gained from a new way of
thinking can help your team feel more enthusiastic about the change.
1. **Take small steps**: After doing more research about an Agile mindset, you
might get excited and feel tempted to change things overnight. Take small steps
and make minor adjustments in the beginning to help your team acclimate.

## What's the impact?

With an Agile mindset, teams can quickly adjust to changing market needs, respond
to customer feedback, and deliver business value. Adopting a new perspective can
positively change a team’s culture, since the shift permits innovation without fear,
collaboration with ease, and delivery without roadblocks.
