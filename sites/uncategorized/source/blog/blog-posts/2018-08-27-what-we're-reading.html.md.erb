At GitLab, we ❤️ reading. Here are a few of our recent pageturners.

### How Rust’s standard library was vulnerable for years and nobody noticed
[Nick Thomas](/company/team/#nick.thomas), Staff Developer, enjoyed
[this article](https://medium.com/@shnatsel/how-rusts-standard-library-was-vulnerable-for-years-and-nobody-noticed-aebf0503c3d6)
on Rust, a new systems programming language. Nick commented, "It was very
interesting from a general-security point of view, especially the
'everything is broken' and 'here is how security advisories actually work' bits."

### Designing Delivery: Rethinking IT in the Digital Service Economy
[Kristie McGoldrick](/company/team/#Krist_McG), Solutions Architect, has been devouring
[this book](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Delivery-Rethinking-Digital-Service/dp/1491949880/ref=mt_paperback?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=),
finding it "very applicable to GitLab."

### It's the Future
[Lin Jen-Shin](/company/team/#godfat-gitlab), Developer, fondly reflects on
[this CircleCI blog post](https://circleci.com/blog/its-the-future/), saying
"I think I'll remember this post forever. One person is trying to persuade
a teammate, who just wants to get things done right now, to use future technology.
The future tech is not mature enough to get things done easily, so it
overcomplicates a lot of things, and the teammate just wants something simple. It's
pretty technical, but it's funny! That future tech is getting closer to becoming
mature now, and GitLab is  trying to use Kubernetes and collaborating with Google
to make this tech better."

### The Phoenix Project: A Novel about IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win

[Rebecca Dodd](/company/team/#rebecca), Content Editor, recently read
["The Phoenix Project"](https://www.amazon.com/Phoenix-Project-DevOps-Helping-Business/dp/0988262509)
and confidently declared that, "I think we’ve
all read 'The Phoenix Project.'"

### The DevOps Handbook: How to Create World-Class Agility, Reliability, and Security in Technology Organizations

[Mike Miranda](/company/team/#zmikemiranda), Sales Development Representative, just
picked up ["The DevOps Handbook"](https://www.amazon.com/DevOps-Handbook-World-Class-Reliability-Organizations-ebook/dp/B01M9ASFQ3/)
to understand the needs of IT leaders.
