In June the Cloud Native Computing Foundation released its chart of the [top open source projects with the highest developer velocity](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2017/06/05/30-highest-velocity-open-source-projects/), and we're proud to be included – in good company!

<!-- more -->

Measuring commits, authors, issues and merge or pull requests, the chart places GitLab in the top right quadrant with eight others including [Kubernetes](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/clusters/index.html) and [Elasticsearch](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/elasticsearch.html).

## Open Source at Heart

While ['open core'](/blog/2016/07/20/gitlab-is-open-core-github-is-closed-source/) might be a more accurate description of GitLab, as we ship both an [open source version](/features/) and [closed source version](/pricing/), we adopt an open source approach to both, with a publicly viewable issue tracker and license that allows modifications once you purchase a license.

We already know that there are good reasons [why you should choose to work with open source projects](/blog/2017/03/03/why-choose-open-source/), and we're grateful to our over [1700 contributors](http://contributors.gitlab.com/contributors) who have helped to shape GitLab – not just the product, but the company too. I work in the Marketing team and am always surprised and pleased when a member of our community pops up in an issue in the [Marketing project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/issues) to offer some input or share an idea. It's a great reminder that [everyone can contribute](/community/contribute/), and those contributions go far beyond development.

So, thank you!
