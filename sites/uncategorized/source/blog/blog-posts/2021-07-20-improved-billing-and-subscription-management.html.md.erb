## What you need to know
- GitLab moves from annual true-ups to quarterly subscription reconciliation
- Introduces cloud licensing and auto-renewals for improved license management
- Requires collection of operational data for customer success services
- Applicable to new customers from **August 1, 2021** and existing customers at their next renewal

---

Today, we are announcing changes to improve the billing and subscription management experience for customers. While quarterly subscription reconciliation benefits both our SaaS and self-managed customers, the three other improvements, including the collection of operational data for customer success services, auto-renewals, and cloud licensing, will enhance the product and service experience for self-managed customers.

While other vendors are shifting to only offering SaaS, we are committed to providing our customers with a choice of deploying GitLab through the GitLab SaaS offering or the GitLab self-managed offering within the customer's datacenter or through a cloud provider of choice. These improvements ensure the self-managed deployment option remains efficient and continues to help customers achieve their desired business outcomes.

The updates are not applicable to free tier users (both SaaS and self-managed) and community program users (GitLab for [Education](/solutions/education/), [Open Source](/solutions/open-source/), and [Startups](/solutions/startups/)). For customers purchasing GitLab via channel partners or resellers, quarterly subscription reconciliation and auto-renewals will not be available at launch, but they will be made available subsequently.

## Four key changes

There are four key changes that will be applicable to new and existing paid tier customers.

### 1. Quarterly subscription reconciliation

Annual [true-ups](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/subscriptions/self_managed/#users-over-license) were confusing and frustrating for customers. With quarterly subscription reconciliation, users added during a quarter will only be charged for the remaining quarters of their subscription term as opposed to the full annual subscription fee(s) with annual true-ups. Customers stand to gain substantial savings for add-on users as there is no retroactive charge. For example:

| Quarter in which users are added | Payment period with quarterly subscription reconciliation | Savings per add-on user compared to annual true-ups |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| First                            | Remaining three quarters only                             | 25%                                                 |
| Second                           | Remaining two quarters only                               | 50%                                                 |
| Third                            | Remaining one quarter only                                | 75%                                                 |
| Fourth                           | Next subscription period only                             | 100%                                                |

Under no scenario will the license cost for add-on users in the quarterly subscription reconciliation model be higher than in the annual true-up model.

### 2. Auto-renewals

Subscriptions on GitLab SaaS are already on auto-renewal. This has made the renewal process more seamless for customers and more efficient for GitLab Inc. After the next renewal, all subscriptions for self-managed customers will be set to auto-renew. There is an option to manually cancel on the [GitLab customer portal](http://customers.gitlab.com) anytime up to thirty (30) days before renewal. If cancelled, customers can continue to use GitLab until their subscription expires.

### 3. Cloud licensing

Self-managed customers will be able to activate their GitLab instances via an activation code and manage their GitLab licenses using the [GitLab customer portal](http://customers.gitlab.com). License data such as subscription tier, active users, guest users, and inactive users will be synced with GitLab daily to facilitate quarterly subscription reconciliation and auto-renewals.

### 4. Operational data

To enable consistent [customer success services](/services/customer-success-services/) for paying customers, self-managed instances will be required to share aggregated operational data that indicates the adoption of product use cases or features. Like [SaaS service usage data](/handbook/legal/privacy/customer-product-usage-information/#saas-gitlabcom-software), operational data for self-managed instances such as number of projects, issues, pipelines, and merge requests will be aggregated for each self-managed instance and will not contain any individual user's personal information or project-specific information. This operational data will be used by customer success services to help customers understand their usage, identify adoption issues, provide use case enablement, and recommend best practices for a successful customer journey. Please see our [service usage data page](/handbook/legal/privacy/customer-product-usage-information/) for the full list of usage data and its use.

Please see our [Customer FAQ](/pricing/faq-improved-billing-and-subscription-management/) for additional details regarding these four key changes.

## Timeline

These changes are applicable to customers purchasing or renewing a GitLab subscription on or after **August 1, 2021**. For existing customers, these changes are applicable at their next renewal. At purchase or renewal -

1. Customers will need to agree to the updated [Subscription Agreement](/terms/).
1. Self-managed customers must be on version **14.1 or newer** to benefit from the upgrade. Existing customers can upgrade at their own pace - GitLab will support the current license management process on 13.x versions and 14.x versions, until further notice.

These changes are not yet available to customers who purchase GitLab through a reseller or channel partner, but will be made available subsequently. Please contact your reseller or channel partner and GitLab channel manager to benefit from these updates.

## More information

The Subscription Agreement and GitLab's legacy Subscription Agreements can be found at the [GitLab Terms of Service](/terms/).

Please find more information in the [Customer FAQs](/pricing/faq-improved-billing-and-subscription-management/). If you require further clarifications, please contact your GitLab Sales Representative or [GitLab Support](https://support.gitlab.com/hc/en-us).

To address any other questions and feedback, we have created a [dedicated topic in the GitLab Community Forum](https://forum.gitlab.com/t/updates-to-paid-tiers-for-improved-billing-and-subscription-management/), which is actively monitored by GitLab team members involved with this change.
