For more than 30 years, [The Open Group](https://www.opengroup.org/) has served as a steward and champion of [open source](https://go.gitlab.com/spHNym) technologies, helping companies achieve business objectives through [open technological standards](http://www.opengroup.org/standardsprocess/main.html). Today, many of the group's approximately 900 member organizations participate in the work of ensuring critical digital technologies remain open and accessible.

The Open Group recently joined the [GitLab Open Source Partners](https://go.gitlab.com/030Ue3) community, where it can connect with other large-scale, open source consortia and projects using GitLab to advance the state of the open source art. So I brewed a cup of tea and sat down with two of the group's team members — Vice President and CTO [Andras Szakal](https://pages.opengroup.org/aszakal) and GitLab administrator [David Diederich](https://pages.opengroup.org/divido) — to hear how using GitLab helps them achieve their group's mission. 

In this interview, you'll learn how:

* [GitLab CI/CD](https://about.gitlab.com/features/continuous-integration) helps the group build scalable open source projects
* adopting GitLab's integrated analysis tools helped the organization deploy complex solutions without the [DevOps tax](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2022/08/24/too-many-toolchains-a-devops-platform-migration-is-the-answer/#eliminating-the-devops-tax)
* GitLab serves as the foundation of the organization's approach to digital transformation
