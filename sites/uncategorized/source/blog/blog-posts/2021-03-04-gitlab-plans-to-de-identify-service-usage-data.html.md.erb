## What isn’t changing

No changes are being made to the policy on service usage data collection from SaaS or Self-Managed customers at this time.

## What is changing

- Further limit [access levels](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/product-intelligence/-/issues/430) to a smaller number of individuals with access to identifiable information. 
- Introduction of a [new system to de-identify users](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-org/-/epics/5248) and other personal information from multi-user instances before the information lands in [GitLab’s analytics environment](/handbook/product/product-intelligence-guide/#systems-overview). This will allow GitLab to roll up more aggregated, de-identified user-level activity at the account level.

## De-identification isn’t perfect

While we will be de-identifying userID and PI, there is a gap for single user namespaces. If a namespace only has a single user, there is potential for them to be linked to that account directly, even after de-identification. We will continue to investigate a solution to this.

## Timeline and implementation

We will collect input on design and implementation over the next 30 days in the [GitLab Community Forum](https://forum.gitlab.com/t/gitlab-is-soliciting-input-on-plans-to-de-identify-service-usage-data/49705). We plan to implement these changes starting in June 2021.
