At GitLab’s second annual Partner Leadership Summit in June, we invited channel, technology, and cloud partners to join us to celebrate their achievements, empower their success, and provide resources and support for the year to come. 

We recognized our partners for their contributions via the Partner Leadership Awards, including Partner of the Year, Public Sector Partner of the Year, Public Sector Distributor of the Year, and Public Sector Services Partner of the Year. 

We also introduced a new award category: Emerging Partner of the Year. The Emerging Partner of the Year award recognizes a new partner who consistently demonstrates a commitment to building a solution practice based on GitLab’s leading DevSecOps platform.

GitLab strives to create collaborative and mutually beneficial relationships with our partners, and we also encourage our partners to embrace GitLab’s values of Collaboration, Results, Efficiency, Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging, Iteration, and Transparency ([CREDIT](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/values/)). Each award winner demonstrated a strong partnership with GitLab and alignment with CREDIT values.
