Before we get too far into 2022, we wanted to take a look back at the most exciting additions to our [DevOps Platform](/topics/devops-platform/) over the last year. Since we release every month on the 22nd, there were lots of new features to consider, but these stood out to me.

## Epic Boards

In [GitLab 14.0](/releases/2021/06/22/gitlab-14-0-released/#epic-boards), we made it easy to keep track of all epics in one place through Epic Boards. Our Epic Boards are customizable with a simple “drag and drop” interface accessible to all teammates, not just the technical ones. Now it’s painless to create general or DevOps-focused workflow states. And teams aren’t just more efficient, they can actually be predictable.

Explore our [Epic Boards](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/group/epics/epic_boards.html).

## Integrations with VS Code and Gitpod

Fans of Visual Studio Code got a much tighter integration with GitLab in 2021. The [GitLab Workflow Extension](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/vscode.html) reduces context switching and improves productivity. And we rounded up [8 ways to get the most out of VS Code and GitLab](/blog/2021/05/20/vscode-workflows-for-working-with-gitlab/).

GitLab also created a tighter integration with Gitpod. Developers can now set up environments as code, greatly [speeding up the process](/blog/2021/07/19/teams-gitpod-integration-gitlab-speed-up-development/). I think this Gitpod integration is so slick I used it to [code, build and deploy from an iPad](/blog/2022/02/10/how-to-code-build-and-deploy-from-an-ipad-using-gitlab-and-gitpod/). Gitpod and its features give developers an opportunity to think outside the box.

## So much security

In 2021 we gave security pros a true “home” in GitLab with our security dashboard. Teams can now [see vulnerabilities in a pipeline](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/application_security/security_dashboard/) and easily slice and dice that data as necessary.

Static application security testing (SAST) also got an upgrade last year. We now have nextgen SAST that will [reduce Ruby false positives](/releases/2021/09/22/gitlab-14-3-released/#next-generation-sast-to-reduce-ruby-false-positives) as well as the ability to automatically test [Infrastructure as Code](/releases/2021/11/22/gitlab-14-5-released/) for the first time.

## Praefect for Gitaly

Customers who want high availability on their own instances now can use Praefect, [our Gitaly clustering solution](/blog/2021/01/21/high-availability-git-storage-with-praefect/), that allows Git to scale. Here’s what you [need to know](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/gitaly/praefect.html) about configuring a Gitaly cluster.

## A visual pipeline editor

It’s hard to build it if you can’t see it, and that’s where our Pipeline Editor comes in. Use Pipeline Editor to [quickly set up CI/CD](/blog/2021/02/22/pipeline-editor-overview/) because it’s now easy to see configurations and dependencies between jobs. Validate and visualize [all parts of the pipeline](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipeline_editor/) without feeling overwhelmed by the complexity.

## Working with (and on) OpenShift

It’s now possible to set up a GitLab Runner for [Red Hat’s popular OpenShift infrastructure](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/openshift.html). Organizations relying on OpenShift can now use [the GitLab Operator](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/10/12/open-shift-ga/) to easily tap into the power of GitLab’s DevOps Platform.

## The GitLab Agent for Kubernetes

Last fall we announced an easier way to tackle GitLab and Kubernetes integrations in a secure and cloud-friendly way: [The GitLab Agent for Kubernetes](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/clusters/agent/). We call this `agentk` and here’s [everything you need to know](/blog/2021/09/10/setting-up-the-k-agent/) about set up.

## 2021 and 2022

If I had to sum it up, I’d say that in 2021 we doubled down on security. And this year, expect us to double down on operations, specifically observability, thanks to our [acquisition of Opstrace](/press/releases/2021-12-14-gitlab-acquires-opstrace-to-expand-its-devops-platform-with-open-source-observability-solution.html). It’s going to be an exciting ride!
