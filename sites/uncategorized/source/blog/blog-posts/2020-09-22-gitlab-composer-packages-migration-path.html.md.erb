## Manage Composer Packages in Gitlab

With Gitlab 13.3, a repository for composer packages was introduced. This allows you to store and manage your private and public composer packages in your Gitlab instance.

### Create Packages

Creating packages is only a matter of adding the composer template to your `.gitlab-ci.yml`. Gitlab will automatically create a package when a git tag was created or a commit was pushed to a branch.

### Migrate your Packages to Gitlab

You might wonder how to create packages for your existing tags of each repository.

You have 2 options:

1. Use curl to create packages manually e.g. ```curl --data tag=1.0.0 'https://__token__:<personal-access-token>@gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/<project_id>/packages/composer'```
2. Use [this package](https://gitlab.com/ochorocho/gitlab-create-package-versions), which will create all packages and their versions for you using the Gitlab API.

## Conclusion

So far it is working pretty well. Publish and install packages works flawlessly. Managing permissions for a package is a breeze.

Currently there is only a group endpoint. I could imagine others may require an instance endpoint to be able to access all packages of a Gitlab instance using a single endpoint/repository.
For now you have to add multiple endpoints/repositories to your composer.json for each group.

In my company, one group contains all shared projects and we were able circumvent adding multiple endpoints/repositories.

There is always room for improvement. For example, the GUI should show more [details about the size of packages and how it was published (manually or via CI)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/254385) and [semantic versioning is not fully supported](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/240887).
If you are interested in GitLab or Composer, both issues are great ways to contribute, so that we can continue to improve this product together.
