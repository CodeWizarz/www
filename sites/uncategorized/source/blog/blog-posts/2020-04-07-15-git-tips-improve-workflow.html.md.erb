This year, [Git](https://git-scm.com/) celebrates its 15th anniversary, and we’ve been excitedly posting some thoughts about its creation and impact — from sharing our experience at [Git Merge 2020](/blog/2020/03/25/git-merge-fifteen-year-git-party/), discussing [the problem with Git flow](/blog/2020/03/05/what-is-gitlab-flow/), or highlighting the newest Git feature [Partial Clone](/blog/2020/03/13/partial-clone-for-massive-repositories/).

Whether you’re just getting started with Git, or you know your way around a command line, it’s always nice to brush up on your skills, which is why we’ve gathered 15 methods to improve your Git-based workflow.

### 1. Git aliases

One of the most impactful ways to improve your daily workflow is to create aliases for common commands to save you some time in the terminal.

You can use the following commands to create aliases for the most-used Git commands, `checkout`, `commit` and `branch`.

```
git config --global alias.co checkout
git config --global alias.ci commit
git config --global alias.br branch
```

Instead of typing `git checkout master`, you only need to type `git co master`.

You could also edit these commands or add more by modifying the `~/.gitconfig` file directly:

```
[alias]
    co = checkout
    ci = commit
    br = branch
```

### 2. See the repository status in your terminal’s prompt

If you’d like to visualize the status of your repository, you can run `git-prompt.sh`
(you can [download it](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/completion/git-prompt.sh) and follow the
instructions to use it in your system). If you're using Linux
and have installed Git with your package manager, it may already be
present on your system, likely under `/etc/bash_completion.d/`.

You can replace your standard shell prompt with something a bit more exciting:

### 3. Compare commits from the command line

A simple way to compare the differences between commits or versions of the same file is to use the `git diff` command.

If you want to compare the same file between different commits, you run the following:

```
$ git diff $start_commit..$end_commit -- path/to/file
```

If you want to compare the changes between two commits:

```
$ git diff $start_commit..$end_commit
```

These commands will open the diff view inside the terminal, but if you prefer to use a more visual tool to compare your diffs, you can use `git difftool`. [Meld](https://meldmerge.org/) is a useful viewer/editor to visually compare diffs.

To configure Meld:

```
$ git config --global diff.tool git-meld
```

To start viewing the diffs:

```
$ git difftool $start_commit..$end_commit -- path/to/file
# or
$ git difftool $start_commit..$end_commit
```

### 4. Stashing uncommitted changes

If you’re ever working on a feature and need to do an emergency fix on the project, you could run into a problem. You don’t want to commit an unfinished feature, and you also don’t want to lose current changes. The solution is to temporarily remove these changes with the Git stash command:

```
$ git stash
```

The git stash command hides changes, giving you a clean working directory and the ability to switch to a new branch to make updates, without having to commit a meaningless snapshot in order to save the current state.

Once you’re done working on a fix and want to revisit your previous changes, you can run:

```
$ git stash pop
```

And your changes will be recovered. 🎉

If you no longer need those changes and want to clear the stash stack, you can do so with:

```
$ git stash drop
```

### 5. Pull frequently

If you’re using [GitLab Flow](/solutions/gitlab-flow/), then you’re working
on feature branches. Depending on how long your feature takes to implement, there might be several changes made to the master branch. In order to avoid major conflicts, you should frequently pull the changes from the master branch to your branch to resolve any conflicts as soon as possible and to make merging your branch to master easier.

### 6. Autocomplete commands

Using [completion scripts](https://github.com/git/git/tree/master/contrib/completion), you can quickly create the commands for `bash`, `tcsh` and `zsh`. If you want to type `git pull`, you can type just the first letter with `git p` followed by <kbd>Tab</kbd> will show the following:

```
pack-objects   -- create packed archive of objects
pack-redundant -- find redundant pack files
pack-refs      -- pack heads and tags for efficient repository access
parse-remote   -- routines to help parsing remote repository access parameters
patch-id       -- compute unique ID for a patch
prune          -- prune all unreachable objects from the object database
prune-packed   -- remove extra objects that are already in pack files
pull           -- fetch from and merge with another repository or local branch
push           -- update remote refs along with associated objects
```

To show all available commands, type `git` in your terminal followed by
<kbd>Tab</kbd>+ <kbd>Tab</kbd>.

### 7. Set a global `.gitignore`

If you want to avoid committing files like `.DS_Store` or Vim `swp` files,
you can set up a global `.gitignore` file.

Create the file:

```bash
touch ~/.gitignore
```

Then run:

```bash
git config --global core.excludesFile ~/.gitignore
```

Or manually add the following to your `~/.gitconfig`:

```ini
[core]
  excludesFile = ~/.gitignore
```
You can create a list of the things you want Git to ignore. To learn more, visit the [gitignore documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore).

### 8. Enable Git’s autosquash feature by default

Autosquash makes it easier to squash commits during an interactive rebase. It can be enabled for each rebase using `git rebase -i --autosquash`, but it's easier to turn it on by default.

```bash
git config --global rebase.autosquash true
```

Or manually add the following to your `~/.gitconfig`:

```ini
[rebase]
  autosquash = true
```

### 9. Delete local branches that have been removed from remote on fetch/pull

You likely have stale branches in your local repository that no longer exist in the remote one. To delete them in each fetch/pull, run:

```bash
git config --global fetch.prune true
```

Or manually add the following to your `~/.gitconfig`:

```ini
[fetch]
  prune = true
```

### 10. Use Git blame more efficiently

Git blame is a handy way to discover who changed a line in a file. Depending on what you want to show, you can pass different flags:

```
$ git blame -w  # ignores white space
$ git blame -M  # ignores moving text
$ git blame -C  # ignores moving text into other files
```

### 11. Add an alias to check out merge requests locally

A [merge request](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/) contains all the history from a repository, and the additional
commits added to the branch associated with the MR. You can check out a public merge request locally even if the source project is a fork (even a private fork) of the target project.

To check out a merge request locally, add the following alias to your `~/.gitconfig`:

```
[alias]
  mr = !sh -c 'git fetch $1 merge-requests/$2/head:mr-$1-$2 && git checkout mr-$1-$2' -
```

Now you can check out a merge request from any repository and any remote. For example, to check out the merge request with ID 5 as shown in GitLab
from the `upstream` remote, run:

```
git mr upstream 5
```

This will fetch the merge request into a local `mr-upstream-5` branch and check
it out. In the above example, `upstream` is the remote that points to GitLab
which you can find out by running `git remote -v`.

### 12. An alias of `HEAD`

Breaking news: `@` is the same as `HEAD`. Using it during a rebase is a lifesaver:

```bash
git rebase -i @~2
```

### 13. Resetting files

You’re modifying your code when you suddenly realize that the changes you made are not great, and you’d like to reset them. Rather than clicking undo on everything you edited, you can reset your files to the HEAD of the branch:

```
$ git reset --hard HEAD
```

Or if you want to reset a single file:

```
$ git checkout HEAD -- path/to/file
```

Now, if you already committed your changes, but still want to revert back, you can use:

```
$ git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

### 14. The `git-open` plugin

If you’d like to quickly visit the website that hosts the repository you’re on, you’ll need `git-open`.

[Install it](https://github.com/paulirish/git-open#installation) and take it for a spin by cloning a repository from
[GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com/explore). From your terminal, navigate to the
repository and run `git open` to be transferred to the project’s page on
GitLab.com.

The plugin works by default for projects hosted on GitLab.com, but you can also use it
with your own GitLab instances. In that case, set up the domain name with:

```bash
git config gitopen.gitlab.domain git.example.com
```

You can open different remotes and branches if they have been set up. You can learn more by checking out the [examples section](https://github.com/paulirish/git-open#examples).

### 15. The `git-extras` plugin

If you want to elevate Git with more commands, try out the
[`git-extras` plugin](https://github.com/tj/git-extras), which includes `git info` (show
information about the repository) and `git effort` (number of commits per file).
