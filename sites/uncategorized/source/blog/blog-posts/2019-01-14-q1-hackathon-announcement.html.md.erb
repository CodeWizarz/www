First of all, I want to wish a Happy New Year to everyone in the GitLab community! I'm certainly looking forward to continued collaboration with everyone in 2019. Following successful [Hackathons in 2018](/community/hackathon/past-events/), I'm excited to announce that the first Hackathon this year will take place on Feb. 12-13.

## What's the deal?

This is a virtual event where community members get together to work on merge requests (MRs) and also to welcome and help new contributors. We will be adding more details on [the Hackathon landing page](/community/hackathon/), as we get closer to the event, including prizes for everyone who has MRs merged within 10 days of the conclusion of the Hackathon.

## What else is taking place?

We are again planning tutorial sessions where community experts will lead presentations plus Q&A sessions on a variety of topics. As speakers get confirmed, you will see tutorial sessions added on [the Hackathon landing page](/community/hackathon/). All the tutorial sessions will be recorded and added to the [GitLab Hackathon playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFGfElNsQthapq-CyXBTVnT2yKqg1JrNh). If you missed tutorials from past Hackathons, I encourage you to check out videos from the playlist.

For the upcoming Hackathon, we will also be highlighting issues from different [GitLab product categories](/handbook/product/categories/) that we want to encourage community members to work on. There will be additional prizes for community members who work on these issues and have MRs merged.

## Where can I find help during the Hackathon?

For communications during the Hackathon, we will again use the [GitLab Community room in Gitter](https://gitter.im/gitlabhq/community). This is a channel designed to have community-related discussions and for community members to help each other as people have questions when contributing to GitLab. This is open to everyone, so please [join the room](https://gitter.im/gitlabhq/community) if you are not part of it already.

## How do I get started with contributing?

A good place to start is the [Contributing to GitLab page](/community/contribute/), where you can learn how you can
contribute to GitLab code, documentation, translation, and UX design.

If you have any questions, you are always welcome to reach me at rpaik@gitlab.com.
