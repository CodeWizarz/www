We’re very excited to announce the GitLab community has a new home on Stack Overflow: the GitLab Collective.
 
We know we already have a great relationship with our contributors and the open source community but [the GitLab Collective](https://stackoverflow.com/collectives/gitlab) on Stack Overflow will take that to the next level. Our collective will be a place contributors and developers can learn and share about version control, CI/CD, DevSecOps, all-remote, DevOps platforms and more.
 
“Community is at the core of GitLab’s mission,” says [Brendan O’Leary](/company/team/#brendan), senior developer evangelist at GitLab. “With a contributor community of more than 2,600 people, we have a strong community aligned with our mission – to create a world where everyone can contribute. We believe the GitLab Collective will be a place where we can discover feedback and create opportunities for the GitLab community to contribute to Stack Overflow’s community.”

Finding your way around the GitLab Collective is easy: look for the “gitlab” tag, or add “gitlab” to a more specific product search, like “gitlab-ci.” Ask questions, dive into in-depth technical data, or browse through how-to guides and articles. Contributions to the GitLab Collective will be tracked on a leaderboard, and if you’re a top contributor, we might tap you as a “Recognized Member” (basically a GitLab-approved guide who can help with questions and make recommendations).

## What comes next

If you’re already a Stack Overflow user, please head to the GitLab Collective and start answering questions (you can ask questions too!). If you’re not a Stack Overflow user, we’d highly recommend you [join the community](https://stackoverflow.com). And remember you’ll earn reputation points on Stack Overflow by participating. 

Right now we’re in the process of creating the documentation that will outline how to become a “Recognized Member” on the GitLab Collective on Stack Overflow. As a Recognized Member, people can recommend answers and write articles on the GitLab Collective to help the community and show off their expertise. Recognized Members will also get a special badge on Stack Overflow that denotes them as a Recognized Members. More to come on this program so watch this space!
