            %p Technology has the power to change the world. Whether itâ€™s software for a critical medical device or an app that can detect your running speed, technology is constantly changing the way we interact with the world around us.
            %br
            %p To keep up with this pace, modern software development must embrace modern tools and adapt to modern workflows. Migrating to a Distributed Version Control System like Git, and adopting a Git management solution, means you can take advantage of better collaboration, improved code review processes, cheaper branching and integration with modern tools that simplify and secure the software development lifecycle for larger organizations.
