        %p Increasing development speed is often limited by the boundaries of infrastructure. Enterprises large and small have adopted cloud computing to help them be more efficient in their growth journey. Whether it's managing infrastructure, data storage and recovery, cloud-native application development, or software on-demand – cloud computing is changing the way we deliver software.
