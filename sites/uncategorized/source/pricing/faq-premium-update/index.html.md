## Overview

**Q: What is GitLab announcing related to pricing tiers?**  

A: GitLab [announced](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2023/03/02/gitlab-premium-update/) a new pricing for GitLab Premium, effective **April 3, 2023**. 

This change applies to new GitLab Premium subscriptions starting on or after **April 3, 2023**. For existing GitLab Premium subscriptions (both SaaS and self-managed), this new pricing becomes effective at their next renewal that is on or after **April 3, 2023**. 

This price change does not apply to SaaS and self-managed GitLab Ultimate customers or users of our community programs, including GitLab for [Startups](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/startups/), [Education](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/education/), and [Open Source](https://about.gitlab.com/solutions/open-source/). 

**Q: What is the effective date of these changes?** 

A: The following are the effective dates for the changes:
- For new GitLab Premium subscriptions, the new pricing of GitLab Premium will be effective **April 3, 2023**.
- For existing GitLab Premium subscriptions, the new pricing of GitLab Premium will be effective at their next renewal on or after **April 3, 2023**. 

**Q: Why is GitLab increasing the price of GitLab Premium?** 

A: Over the past five years, we expanded [GitLab Premium](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/premium/) to include [more than 400 features](https://gitlab-com.gitlab.io/cs-tools/gitlab-cs-tools/what-is-new-since/?tab=features&minVersion=10_05&selectedMinTier=premium&selectedMaxTier=premium) across the entire software delivery lifecycle so customers can focus on delivering high-quality software faster. Weâ€™ve added notable capabilities including:
- **Ease of getting started**: Built-in templates and automatic pipeline creation using Auto DevOps make it easy to get started.
- **Pipeline execution**: Parent-child pipelines, directed acyclic graphs, and merge trains help to establish relationships, sequencing, and priorities of jobs to ensure faster execution and keep the target branch stable.
- **Agile planning**: Roadmaps, epics, boards, and milestones enable enterprise Agile planning best practices and management of projects, programs, and products at a team and organizational level.
- **Analytics and visibility**: Value stream analytics, contribution analytics, environments dashboards, MR analytics, code review analytics, and more track metrics driving software delivery efficiency.
- **Release controls**: Code owners, multiple approvers, approval rules, protected environments, various rollout strategies like incremental/canary, feature flags, and fine-grained authentication and authorization mechanisms minimize production risks and ensure shipping high-quality code.
- **Compliance**: Compliance frameworks and audit events enable compliance adherence.
- **Performance and fault tolerance**: Distributed cloning using GitLab Geo, fault-tolerant git storage with Gitaly, geographic replication, and load balancing for self-managed deployment of GitLab for improved performance and fault tolerance. 

See the [upcoming releases roadmap](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/paid_tiers/) to learn how GitLab will continue to iterate on GitLab Premium to deliver value and innovation to customers every month. 


**Q: My renewal is a few days after the effective date. Can I renew now to lock in the current GitLab Premium pricing?** 

A: Renewals can be done no earlier than 14 days before the current subscription end date. At the time of renewal, existing GitLab Premium customers can take advantage of the transition offer.
