# GitLab Promotions Terms & Conditions

The following Terms and Conditions apply to promotions for GitLab purchases (“GitLab Promotions”). GitLab Promotions may be facilitated by offering a one-time discount for a non-refundable purchase. GitLab Promotions are not redeemable for cash or for use towards a previous purchase, and they cannot be transferred or combined with any other offer or discount. GitLab reserves the right to cancel or modify the terms of the GitLab Promotions at any time in its absolute and sole discretion. Please refer below for specific details surrounding current GitLab Promotions and eligibility.

## GitLab Promotions:

[**Renewal Promotion (GitLab Premium):**](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2023/03/02/gitlab-premium-update/) Customers up for a renewal of their current GitLab Premium subscription may qualify for a one-time GitLab Promotion for a twelve (12) month renewal subject to the offer details and duration available in the link above. A discounted rate will be automatically applied to Customers eligible to receive a GitLab Renewal Promotion. To be eligible, the Renewal Promotion requires that a Customer’s account be in good standing with GitLab.

With regard to the GitLab Promtions listed above, any additional User license added during a subscription purchased as part of the foregoing GitLab Promotions (“Add-On Users”) will be invoiced by GitLab quarterly at the same discounted rate and prorated for the balance of the subscription term. If GitLab cannot verify Add-On Users quarterly (once every three months), or Customer does not otherwise provide reasonable evidence of Add-On Users on a quarterly basis, GitLab will perform a true-up at the end of the annual subscription term and invoice Customer for all such Add-On Users during the previous twelve (12) months at the list price at time of invoice for GitLab’s Premium product offering.

The forgoing GitLab Promotion(s) only apply to the GitLab Premium product offering and are limited to a one-time twelve (12) month Subscription purchase.  Other GitLab products or services are not eligible for the GitLab Promotion(s).
