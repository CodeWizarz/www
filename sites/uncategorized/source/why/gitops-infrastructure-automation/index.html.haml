                %p With the demands made on today's infrastructure, it's crucial for organizations to implement infrastructure automation that is repeatable, traceable, and less prone to human error. GitOps takes DevOps best practices used for application development, such as version control, collaboration, compliance, and CI/CD, and applies them to modern infrastructure automation.
                %p Watch this panel discussion where we asked tech leaders what teams need to make the shift to GitOps, and the benefits of managing infrastructure using GitOps.
