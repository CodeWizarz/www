          About the package repository
      .panel-body
        With GitLab 7.10 we have introduced package repositories for GitLab,
        that allow you to install GitLab with a simple 'apt-get' command.
        %br/
        %br/
        If you are coming from a manually downloaded Omnibus package,
        you can quickly and easily upgrade. Find the instructions for
        %a{href: "#debian"}
          Debian /
          Ubuntu here
        and the instructions for
        = succeed "." do
          = link_to "CentOS here", "#centos"
        %br/
        %br/
        These instructions will install the GitLab EE package, which is
        = succeed "." do 
          %a{href: "https://about.gitlab.com/install/ce-or-ee/"} our recommended edition
        if you would like to install the CE package just replace 
        %code `gitlab-ee`
        with 
        = succeed "." do
          %code `gitlab-ce`
        If you are on CE, upgrading to EE is as easy as
        = succeed "." do
          %a{href: "https://about.gitlab.com/upgrade/"} installing the EE package

        %h2.panel-title
          Ubuntu / Debian: Upgrading from manually downloaded Omnibus package
      .panel-body
        To upgrade you will need to add the package repository to your
        system first.
        %br/
        %br/
        Call the following script for easy installation:
        %br/
        %pre
          :preserve
            curl https://packages.gitlab.com/install/repositories/gitlab/gitlab-ee/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
        If you are not comfortable installing the repository through a
        piped script, you can find the
        = succeed "." do
          %a{href: "https://packages.gitlab.com/gitlab/gitlab-ee/install"} entire script here
        %br/
        Now you will be able to install / upgrade GitLab to the latest version
        using the package repository. When running the command below,
        GitLab will detect a conflict and remove
        %code gitlab
        in favor
        of
        = succeed "." do
          %code gitlab-ee
        %br/
        %br/
        To upgrade, run:
        %pre sudo apt-get install gitlab-ee
        %br/
        You are now ready to use GitLab again!
    #centos.panel.panel-warning
      .panel-heading
        %h2.panel-title
          CentOS: Upgrading from manually downloaded Omnibus package
      .panel-body
        To upgrade you will need to add the package repository to your
        system first.
        %br/
        %br/
        Use the following:
        %pre curl https://packages.gitlab.com/install/repositories/gitlab/gitlab-ee/script.rpm.sh | sudo bash
        If you are not comfortable installing the repository through a
        piped script, you can find the
        = succeed "." do
          %a{href: "https://packages.gitlab.com/gitlab/gitlab-ee/install"} entire script here
        %br/
        %br/
        Now you will be able to install / upgrade GitLab to the latest version
        using the package repository. When running the command below,
        GitLab will detect a conflict and remove
        %code gitlab
        in favor
        of
        = succeed "." do
          %code gitlab-ee
        %br/
        %br/
        To upgrade, run:
        %pre sudo yum install gitlab-ee
        %br/
        Due to the order in which RPM post-removal and post-installations scripts run,
        the change from
        %code gitlab
        to
        %code gitlab-ee
        removes
        %code /user/bin/gitlab-ctl
        and related commands. This does not affect
        Debian-based systems (Debian, Ubuntu).
        %br/
        %br/
        As a workaround on RPM-based systems, please run the following command
        %i after
        upgrading to the package repository, the first time:
        %br/
        %pre
          :preserve
            sudo ln -sf                       \
              /opt/gitlab/bin/gitlab-ctl      \
              /opt/gitlab/bin/gitlab-rake     \
              /opt/gitlab/bin/gitlab-rails    \
              /opt/gitlab/bin/gitlab-ci-rake  \
              /opt/gitlab/bin/gitlab-ci-rails \
              /usr/bin/        Note that the post-install message of the package will also tell you to make this change.
        %br/
        %br/
        Now you're ready to use GitLab again!
