        %h3 Retired Certification
        Prior to May 16, 2023 we offered a GitLab Certified DevOps Professional self-paced technical certification. This certification has been retired as we update content for a new DevSecOps certification. See our <a href="https://levelup.gitlab.com/pages/certifications">Certifications</a> page for current offerings and watch for updates on <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/">our blog</a> for the release of the new certification.
