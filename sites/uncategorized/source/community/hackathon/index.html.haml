            The Hackathon is a virtual event open to anyone who is interested in contributing code, translations, UX designs and more to GitLab.
            By participating in GitLab's Hackathon, you have the opportunity to work on issues that matter to you and advance your skills/experience while joining a global, diverse and inclusive team of contributors and GitLab team members.
          %p
            The Hackathon is scheduled to run for 7 days, to be inclusive. This accommodates participants who contribute during both their work hours and free time.
            GitLab reviewers normally review MRs from Monday to Friday.
