Another GitLab hackathon is completed, and I would like to begin by celebrating our community contributions! Congratulations to everyone who participated and contributed to GitLab.

This time, we set a record high of 389 submitted MRs, from 41 participants across 12 projects such as: GitLab, Omnibus, GitLab Development Kit, CNG, Runner and more.
As of today, 334 MRs have been merged which translates to 85.86% of the MRs submitted.

As you can see in the picture below, the success of this hackathon is following a positive trend on MRs submitted and merged per Hackathon.

During this Hackathon, a number of GitLab Team members ran a series of office hours focusing on various GitLab Products, stages and groups like Runner, Release Stage and Package Group. All of these sessions that are a resource for future contributions were recorded and can be found on our [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL05JrBw4t0KrqGydhkV_BUPrI-DBiDKfm).


## Hackathon prizes

Like past events, everyone who had MRs merged will receive a token of our appreciation for their contribution. This time, [twenty nine](https://gitlab.biterg.io/goto/4246be20bb3935e5ead112b3a00acf32) contributors had their MRs merged. Three of these contributors had more than 11 MRs merged and will receive the Second Prize level reward.
