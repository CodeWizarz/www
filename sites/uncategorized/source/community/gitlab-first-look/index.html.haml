        What do engineering leaders need in order to understand their teamsâ€™ workload at a high level? Could we make it easier to enable security scanning in MRs? How can we bring accessibility testing seamlessly into the development process? What are the biggest frustrations and joys in being a DevOps engineer? Should that button go here or there? ðŸ¤”
      %p
        Every day, our UX Researchers, Product Designers, and Product Managers ask questions like these to people like you! We work together with our various teams to investigate and drive forward each of our product stages - whether you canâ€™t live without it or itâ€™s driving you up the wall, chances are thereâ€™s a study coming soon.
      %p
        We developed GitLab First Look to make sure we are speaking with the right people at the right time. When you join, youâ€™ll receive invitations to take part in surveys, user interviews, and usability tests that you match with.
      %p
        Whether you have been using GitLab for years or perhaps you just logged on this week, we want to hear from you. At GitLab, we believe everyone can contribute.

        %h4 User interviews
        %p During a user interview, youâ€™ll chat 1 on 1 with a UX Researcher, Product Designer, or Product Manager. Weâ€™ll cover topics related to your experiences with GitLab and open-ended questions about how you approach challenges in your role.
      .grid-item
        = image_tag "/images/first-look/first-look-surveys.svg", class: "research-icon", alt: "Gitlab first look surveys logo svg"
        %h4 Surveys
        %p We regularly send out different surveys that help us learn more about the people using GitLab. We use this information to make design and product decisions and to decide which new features to prioritize.
      .grid-item
        = image_tag "/images/first-look/first-look-usability-testing.svg", class: "research-icon", alt: "Gitlab first look usability testing logo svg"
        %h4 Usability testing
        %p During a usability test, you will be asked to complete several short tasks using GitLab and/or a prototype while talking out loud about what youâ€™re doing, thinking, and feeling. Our usability testing sessions may be moderated (meeting with a person live) or unmoderated (just you, following a set of instructions). The important thing to remember is that we are testing the design - not you. Our UX Research team will do their best to put you at ease and provide you with a comfortable experience. 
      .grid-item
        = image_tag "/images/first-look/first-look-card-sorts.svg", class: "research-icon", alt: "Gitlab first look card sorts logo svg"
        %h4 Card sorts
        %p During a card sort, youâ€™ll be asked to organize topics into themes. Usually, this is an unmoderated form of research, but every so often we may ask whether a UX Researcher can observe while you complete the task. Alternatively, a Designer may sit in and ask why you sorted the topics into the themes that you did. Again, this is not a test on you, but a way for us to understand how to best design our product for our users.

        = image_tag "/images/first-look/first-look-design-evals.svg", class: "research-icon", alt: "Gitlab first look design evals logo svg"
        %h4 Design evaluations
        %p During design evaluations, you will be shown one or more images and asked to answer a series of written questions and/or tasks. This is generally an unmoderated form of research.

      *Just like how GitLab is all remote, our research studies are too! All research studies take place remotely from the comfort of your own computer.

    .grid-layout.grid-layout2
      .grid-item
        %h4 What happens after I sign up??
        %p When we have a research study available that youâ€™re a good match for, weâ€™ll send you the full details via email. From there, you can decide if you want to participate by filling out the initial questionnaire.
      .grid-item
        %h4 Do I need to have any particular role to participate?
        %p No! Our needs are wide-ranging, and we want to make sure that GitLab works for everyone. However, there are several types of in-demand roles that we have historically had difficulty recruiting: Security engineers, security specialists, security analysts, engineering directors, business decision makers, CTOs, and similar.
      .grid-item
        %h4 Do I need to be a GitLab user to sign-up?
        %p No, we often conduct research with people who donâ€™t currently use GitLab.
      .grid-item
        %h4 Do I have to live in a certain country to participate?
        %p No, we conduct research with users all over the world. Our team is global, so we cover a wide range of time-zone availability for user interviews. We ask that you speak English, however, for any usability testing or user interviews you take part in. For some interaction design activities, you may also need to write in English. 
      .grid-item
        %h4 Do I have to be 18 or over to participate?
        %p Yes, you must be 18 or over to participate in our research studies. 
      .grid-item
        %h4 What will you do with my personal information?
        %p The information you provide will only be used to pair you with suitable research studies and won't be shared with or sold to external parties.
      .grid-item
        %h4 How do I unsubscribe from GitLab First Look?
        %p
          You can unsubscribe using the link in our emails or
          %a{ href: "mailto:firstlook@gitlab.com?subject=GitLab%20First%20Look" } by contacting us
          directly.
      .grid-item
        %h4 Is there anything else I should know?
        %p At GitLab, we value transparency. By making information public, we can reduce the threshold to contribution and make collaboration easier. 

With your permission, we record all user interviews and usability testing sessions. We would also love to share the recording on GitLab. This is completely voluntary and up to you. In any use of the recordings, no personally identifiable information will be disclosed. We'll ask for your consent before you complete any user interviews or usability testing with GitLab.
