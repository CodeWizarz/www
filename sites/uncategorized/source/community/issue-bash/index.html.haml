            %ul
              %li Finding issues in the tracker that can be easily closed
              %li Categorizing existing issues that are lacking labels
              %li Fixing known bugs and pain points
              %li Shipping of existing feature proposals

            %p There is no shortage of tasks that contributors can try their hand at. Whether this is writing their first merge request to contribute a bug fix or a feature proposal or collaborating with the core team to track down and close some duplicate issues and streamline the issue tracker.
