          %p GitLab supports community leaders who want to organize meetups and tech events in their cities and hometowns. We also work to our meetup organizers with interested speakers and venues. If you are interest in organizing, speaking at, or hosting a GitLab Meetup, let us know by creating an issue.

          %p Our goals in supporting these events are to grow our community, better engage with and increase connections within the GitLab community, increase awareness of GitLab, and better educate the technology community about the power of our platform.

          %p At GitLab, we believe everyone can contribute. We support people who are interested in organizing events or growing existing communities. If you have experience organizing tech events or meetup groups, that is great - but it is not required. We're happy to work with first-time organizers, too.

          %p So what goes into an awesome event?

          %ul
            %li Topics: The most important step in creating a meetup is to choose a topic you are passionate about. Organizing meetups can take a good amount of effort, so you want to make sure you're excited about the subject matter you're sharing. You don't need to be an expert on the topic, but that certainly doesn't hurt. If the topic you choose has an existing group in your area, consider joining the existing group as an organizer rather than starting a competing group.

            %li Build a team: Once you have settled on a topic, start recruiting co-organizers. Message people in your network, post about the new group on social media, and invite folks from other meetups in your area to join the team. Having a group of organizers in place will reduce your workload, and it will increase the visibility of the group as each organizer can leverage their network for speakers and guests.

            %li Speakers: GitLab has a "Find a Speaker" page which can be a good place to start. You can reach out to past speakers from other meetup groups or conferences in your area. Include a link to a Google Form in your group's description to create a pipeline for interested speakers to submit ideas for talks.

            %li Venues: Your group will need a place to meet (although remote meetups are gaining popularity), and you want to ensure you pick a place that can accommodate your guests comfortably. Cafés, community centers, and coworking spaces are popular venues for meetups. In some cities, as groups grow, they may need to find bigger spaces - such as auditoriums.
