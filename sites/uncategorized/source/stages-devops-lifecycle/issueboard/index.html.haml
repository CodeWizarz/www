      %h3
        One tool, endless functionality
      %p
        Everything is in one place. Track issues and communicate progress without switching between products. One interface to follow your issues from backlog to done.
    .feature-item.col-md-10.col-md-push-1
      = icon("issue-boards/icon-benefit-2", "feature-icon", { label: "Beautiful and comprehensive" })
      %h3
        Beautiful and comprehensive
      %p
        It’s more than a visual representation. It’s your issues, your labels, and all the metadata that comes with them. And you still have all of the same sorting and filtering tools that you use across GitLab.
    .feature-item.col-md-10.col-md-push-1
      = icon("issue-boards/icon-benefit-3", "feature-icon", { label: "Flexible setup" })
      %h3
        Flexible setup
      %p
        You define your process and we organize it. You create the label. We create the corresponding column and pull in your existing issues. When you're ready you drag and drop from one step to the next.

                  [Labels](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/labels.html){:data-ga-name="labels"}{:data-ga-location="body"} make it easy to categorize issues based on descriptive titles. They help teams quickly understand the context of an issue. Labels can be used to describe the issue type, like "new feature," or describe the issue stage, like "QA."

                    Create your first label: it's simple, you can create it from

                    itself or by navigating to the [labels area](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/labels.html#create-new-labels){:data-ga-name="labels area"}{:data-ga-location="body"}.

                    If you already have labels, it's time to meet the Issue Board!

                    Find your Issue Board by navigating to your project's **Issues > Board**. By default, there's a list called **Backlog**, where you'll find all the issues in that project, and there's a list called **Done**, which will contain all the issues that have already been closed. Now let's create some new lists.

              .lead.text-center.step-lead-text
                :markdown
                  Lists are based on the labels already created for your project.<br>Each list contains the issues that are assigned to the corresponding label.

                  :markdown
                    Click **"Create new list"** and choose a label to create the list from. Once done, the list will appear as a new column on your board, and the issues assigned to that label will automatically move from Backlog to your new list. If you are starting fresh, you can add GitLab's suggested default lists to your Issue Board in one click.

                    Once you have created your lists, you can drag-and-drop to re-order them to match your team's flow.

                    Move an issue between two lists and the label will swap to the new list.

                    Every time you create a new issue with any of the labels in your lists or you create a new issue right from the Board, the issue will be automatically displayed on your Issue Board.

                    When you're done working, simply move the card to **Done** and the issue will be automatically closed for you!

                    Create multiple Issue Boards for each of your projects.

                    It's simple: navigate to your Issue Board, click <i class="fas fa-caret-down" style="color: rgb(49,163,92)" aria-hidden="true"></i> to open a dropdown menu that will give you the
                    option to create new boards, edit the existing ones, or delete the boards you
                    don't need anymore. Use the same dropdown menu to navigate between your boards.

                    Create Issue Boards at the group level and manage all issues
                    of the underlying projects in a single and concentrated view.

                    Lists, labels, and milestones are all managed at the group
                    level, allowing you to focus on the group. This means a team
                    may naturally be working across multiple projects, making it
                    extremely helpful to manage issues across all those projects
                    together.
