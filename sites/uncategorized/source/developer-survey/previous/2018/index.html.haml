            %p.intro Software professionals collectively recognize the value of working in highly collaborative environments, and have experienced the benefits of doing so. While developers and managers are culturally aligned, workflow and tooling roadblocks delay delivery, preventing teams from reaching their maximum potential.

            %p As we look at 2018 and beyond, IT organizations that successfully adopt continuous improvement practices and seamless automation across their software development lifecycle will have happier, more collaborative, and well-functioning teams who are better positioned to meet their goals and objectives.

        %p From the junior developer with just a handful of years’ experience to the software professional who’s been in the game for decades, we set out to see how the people behind the software are dealing with a rapidly changing technology landscape.

        %p We examined overall attitudes and perceptions on the state of culture, workflow, and tooling within IT organizations with the goal to uncover any disparities between developers and IT management. We also looked at how remote versus in-office cultures are faring, compared the attitudes of agile and DevOps teams, and exposed the trends propelling high-performing teams.

        %p
          This year, we confirmed that
          = link_to "high-performing", "#methodology", class: "js-smoothscroll"
          teams are more likely to report having a strong DevOps culture, resulting in better visibility and collaboration than their lower-functioning counterparts. High-performing teams also report having better access to the best development tools, spend less time context switching, and are more likely to be using cloud-based tools. For leaders of high-performing teams, automating the software development lifecycle is a top priority.

          %p We found that culturally, developers and upper management are aligned, placing high value on collaboration and communication. Managers are more optimistic about the time savings of practicing DevOps, with 81% agreeing that DevOps saves time in the development process, while only 65% of developers agree. There also appears to be a perception gap regarding how often organizations deploy code, with 47% of managers reporting that they deploy code on demand or multiple times a day, compared to only 39% of developers.

In addition to deploying on-demand, high performers experience a host of other benefits, reporting that they are more likely to feel set up to succeed, are given realistic deadlines, and are less likely to feel the need to sacrifice quality to meet a deadline. Likewise, respondents who reported using a DevOps workflow believe they are the leaders in deploying on demand and are more likely to automate more of their software development lifecycle.

Flexible workplace and time-tracking policies are common, with productivity measured by results rather than time spent.

Similar percentages (roughly 75%) of each group feel set up to succeed in their jobs, and about two-thirds agree that they are given realistic deadlines. Twenty percent of developers, and nearly the same proportion of managers, feel they are not given realistic deadlines. Only half of developers agree that project expectations and requirements are set up front, and a third say they are not.

          %p Transparency lags behind for some teams, with a quarter of developers indicating they do not have visibility into what others, such as their colleagues in operations, product, and security, are working on. Remote or mostly remote teams lead their in-office counterparts in visibility into what others are working on, likely due to the fact that remote teammates need to be more deliberate about communication and planning in order to succeed.

          %p Although a strong majority feel comfortable proposing new ways of working, they face difficulty overcoming the status quo. Replacing ingrained practices, along with a resistance to change, are the top two challenges identified by all respondents.

          %em Process and procedure is often a hotly contested topic. Too much can hinder a team’s ability to adapt and innovate, too little can result in confusion and duplicate work. In this section, we examine the current state of balance between the two.

        %p Manual testing and a change of plans mid-process (often by non-technical stakeholders) cause headaches for developers. As one respondent summarized, “We need to plan better and automate more,” a sentiment that was echoed across multiple responses.

The responses from people who seem dissatisfied with an ad hoc methodology suggest that perhaps their team or company has grown large enough that they need a formalized process, but have lagged behind on implementing one.

Nearly half of respondents said their organization’s use of CI is good or very good, while over one-third of respondents gave their organization’s use of CI an unfavorable rating. When we asked them to elaborate, respondents who indicated that CI is not done extensively at their organization attributed this to a lack of knowledge, skill, and habit. In a few cases, respondents indicated they had been hired expressly to set up CI and help their new team make the transition.

        %h4 Analysis
        %p There’s nearly universal agreement: developers and managers nearly all say it’s important to them to use the best available tools, and a strong majority in each group agrees that they have access to those tools. And yet, tools comprise three out of the top four concerns named by managers when asked the challenges they face supporting their investments in 2018, indicating that maintaining a sophisticated toolchain is an important challenge for software teams. Developers appear content with their tools overall; with concern over being forced to use the wrong tool for the job ranked last on their list of challenges.

      .row.u-margin-bottom-md
        .col-md-8.col-md-offset-1
          %p Managers prefer open source to closed source tools, say that using an open source tool improves software quality. Additionally, the majority of managers agree that open source tools streamline the development process and improve security at a higher rate than developers. Managers were nearly 20% more likely to say that using an open source tool is important to their development organization, suggesting perhaps that vendor lock-in is more salient for managers weighing available options.

To rely on a paid/closed software is a risk that I don’t think it’s [sic] worth paying. Otherwise, my company still thinks that big and strong enterprise softwares are worth its costs, mainly in the infrastructure areas (operational systems and databases). We are now more open to open source because of budget limitations.

          %p We launched this Global Developer Survey on November 17, 2017, collecting responses until December 18, 2017. During that time, we promoted the survey primarily on GitLab’s social media channels and newsletter. In order to correct for the gender imbalance developing in our survey sample, we made an extra push via Twitter on December 5 to encourage women involved in the software development lifecycle to take the survey. By the end of the open period, we achieved approximately 25% female respondents, the same percentage of women who currently hold computing roles, according to NCWIT.

            %p Higher-performing teams are defined by developers who told us that they deploy their code on demand, multiple times per day, and who estimated that they spend 50% or more of their time on new work (n=913). Lower-performing teams are defined by developers who told us that they deploy their code “between once per day and once per month” and “between once per month and once every six months.” (n=601) We took inspiration from the State of DevOps report, which identifies deployment frequency and time spent on new work versus rework as two of several indicators of high- and low-performing organizations. To ensure we had a big enough segment to compare, we lumped together everyone who does not deploy on -demand into the lower-performing category.
