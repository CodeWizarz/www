          %h2 GDPR overview
          %p.overview
            The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a European privacy law that is set to go into effect in May 2018. The GDPR replaces the Data Protection Directive that was put into place in 1995. Although it is a European law, it will impact any entity that does business in or offers services and goods to people in the European Union (EU), regardless of their location. It will also apply to any entity that collects and analyzes the data of EU residents or businesses.
          %p.overview
            The purpose of GDPR is to protect the private information of EU citizens and give them more control over their personal data. Under GDPR, private information is defined as any information that is directly or indirectly identifiable to an individual. This includes information such as social security numbers, location data, online identifiers, pseudonymous data, and genetic or biometric data, such as fingerprints and facial recognition.
          %p.overview
            Specifically, GDPR grants EU citizens these controls over their personal data:
          %ul
            %li
              %strong Right of access:
              Data controllers will be required to fulfill requests from individuals seeking access to their private data or information on how it is being used. Data collectors and processors will have to detail how the personal information was obtained, how and why it is being used, as well as with whom the company is sharing the information. Companies will also be mandated to provide the individual with a copy of their personal records.
            %li
              %strong Notice of security breaches:
              Individuals must be alerted within 72 hours if their personal data has been hacked or otherwise compromised.
            %li
              %strong “Right to erasure”:
              Individuals can decide they no longer want their personal data to be processed and request that all of their information be deleted.
            %li
              %strong Data portability:
              Individuals will be permitted to move their personal data from one company to another upon request, without opposition from the data controller.
          %h2 CCPA overview
          %p.overview
            The California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA) took effect on January 1, 2020. Similar to GDPR, CCPA is intended to protect person information and also articulates the rights that California consumers have regarding their information. CCPA applies specifically to residents of California.
          %p.overview
            The definition of Person Information in CCPA is very similar to GDPR's definition of Personal Data: "Information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household."
          %p.overview
            Just as GDPR establishes rights for EU citizens, CCPA establishes certain rights for California residents:
          %ul
            %li
              %strong The rights to disclosure of data collected and sold:
              California residents have the right to request access to their personal information and to ask how their data is used by the company after it has been gathered. If the information is being shared or sold, this must be disclosed when requested.
            %li
              %strong The right to deletion:
              Companies must delete a Consumer's personal information upon request.
            %li
              %strong The right to opt out of sales of Personal Information:
              If a company sells personal information, consumers have the right to opt out.
            %li
              %strong The right to non-discrimination:
              If a consumer exercises their rights under CCPA, the business may not discriminate against the consumer. For instance, they company cannot deny service or charge different rates to a consumer who exercises their rights under CCPA.

          %h2  Key GDPR requirements
          %p.overview
            Companies within and outside of the European Union will be required to make a number of adjustments to the way they access and process the personal data of EU residents in order to be GDPR compliant.

          %p.overview
            The identification of information controllers and processors are key components to creating GDPR compliance.

            .panel-body
              %p.overview
                Controllers are a company or organization that determines the purpose for and manner in which personal data is processed.
              %p.overview
                Controllers can also be processors.

            .panel-heading
              %h3.panel-title What are processors?
            .panel-body
              %p.overview
                Data processors take the information controllers have accumulated and process the personal information.
              %p.overview
                GitLab’s CI/CD tools fall under the processor category.

      .row
        .col-md-10.col-md-offset-1
          %p.overview
            The responsibility of GDPR compliance is heavily imposed on controllers. Data controllers are responsible and liable for GDPR compliance in the processing of personal data, even in cases when they have outsourced processing activities to another company. Nonetheless, processors are also obligated to be GDPR compliant under the law.

          %p.overview
            To inquire about executing a DPA, please contact your Sales Account Manager. If you do not know your Account Manager, please email dpo@gitlab.com

                  %p Companies that have personal data collection or processing at the core of their business will be required to hire or appoint a data protection officer (DPO).
                  %p Specifically, a DPO will be required by GDPR if a company processes a large amount of personal or sensitive data regarding criminal offenses or convictions. Companies that regularly and systematically monitor the personal data of individuals on a large scale are also required to have a DPO in order to be GDPR compliant.

                %td
                  %p Individuals must be directly notified of security breaches that affect their personal data within 72 hours.
                  %p Supervisory authorities must be advised of security breaches that present a risk to the rights and freedom of individuals within 72 hours. The general public must be immediately alerted of security breaches that are sufficiently serious.
